The City and San Jose Police Officers ’ Association (SJPOA) recognize that, despite best \\nefforts to promote safety, police officers and sergeants are injured in the line of duty. Such \\ninjuries are unfortunate but can be a consequence of police work. The Exempt Officers ’ \\nand Sergeants ’ Modified Duty Program (“Program ”) is available to any police officer or \\nsergeant that has work -related or non -work related injuries or illnesses which preclude \\nhim or her from performing the f ull scope of his or her duties without accommodation.  \\n2. The City and SJPOA recognize that police officers and sergeants exist to enforce the law \\nand protect public safety. Some essential job duties of a police officer and sergeant \\ninclude, but are not limite d to, engaging in physically strenuous tasks, such as making \\nforcible arrests, pursuing fleeing suspects, responding to mass celebrations and \\ndemonstrations, and responding to emergency situations.  \\n3. The City and SJPOA recognize that officers and sergeants w ith physical restrictions can \\nrepresent a valuable resource to the Police Department. Given the training and \\nexperience obtained by and invested in police officers and sergeants, the Police \\nDepartment can benefit from the knowledge and experience of office rs and sergeants \\nwith physical restrictions.  \\n4. The Program is intended to provide temporary modified duty assignments for officers or \\nsergeants with temporary work restrictions until the officer or sergeant is returned to full -\\nduty status or meets the maximu m duration of participation in the Program as outlined \\nbelow.  \\n5. The City and SJPOA recognize the legitimate interest of the San Jose Police Department \\nin maximizing the number of officers and sergeants available for Patrol duties, and other \\nphysically strenuous activities. The responsibilities of the Police Department are largely \\nphysical, involving suppression of criminal activity and exhibiting levels of force necessary \\nto control dangerous and unruly situations. Emergency situations also m ay require the \\nDepartment to provide a large uniformed presence. Additionally, at any particular time, \\nbecause of short -term disabilities, sick leave, military leave, training missions, family \\nleave, and the like, in addition to those in the Program, offic ers and sergeants are \\nunavailable for Patrol activities, reducing the actual level of officers and sergeants who \\nmay participate in Patrol assignments on a day -to-day basis. While the Department \\nrecognizes that non -physical assignments represent necessary and valuable aspects of \\npolice work, the philosophy of the Department is clearly Patrol -oriented. The first and \\nmain duty of the Department is the visible protection of the public. Because of these \\nprinciples, the parties recognize that the Department has a legitimate interest in limiting \\nthe number of officers and sergeants on the force who are physically unable to perform \\nthe strenuous physical activities necessary in a Patrol assignment. A goal of the Program \\nis to strike a balance between the business n eeds of the Department and the interests of \\ninjured officers and sergeants in meaningful employment in a temporary modified duty \\nassignment. Additionally, nothing in the Program requires the City of San Jose to change \\nits policies and procedures regarding the recruiting and hiring of police officers to entry -\\nlevel employment .

The City and SJPOA recognize that the administration of the Police Department \\ncontinues to change over time, based on budget, staffing, criminal justice priorities, \\nnegotiated terms an d conditions of employment, and numerous other factors. In view of \\nthe fluid nature of the organization, the parties intend to provide for flexibility in \\nadministering this Program, and recognize that changes in circumstances may require \\nchanges in the Pro gram beyond the provisions contemplated herein. The Police \\nDepartment is committed to periodic review of positions within the Department, with a \\nview toward inclusion of positions in the Program. A goal of the Program is to provide for \\nflexibility in admin istering the Program to facilitate changed circumstances and maximum \\ninclusion of positions, given the interests of the Department and its officers and sergeants.  \\n7. The City and SJPOA recognize an employer’s and its employees ’ obligations under the \\nAmericans  with Disabilities Act and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.  \\n8. The purpose of the Program is to provide a temporary modified duty Program for officers \\nand sergeants with temporary work restrictions.  \\nSince this Program is to provide temporary modified duty, officers and sergeants with \\npermanent work restrictions are not eligible for the Program except as otherwise provided \\nherein. The City will engage in the interactive process with officers and sergea nts with \\npermanent work restrictions .  \\nPROCEDURES  \\n1. Claims regarding the interpretation and application of the specific terms of this Program  \\nshall be grievable under the  Memorandum of Agreement between the City and the San \\nJose Police Officers’ Association , with the exception of any claim that the provisions of \\nthe Program  violate state or federal law.  \\n2. Nothing in the Program affects the provisions as negotiated in the Officer s’ Transfer \\nPolicy or the Sergeants’ Transfer Policy with respect to officers and sergeants not \\ncovered by this Program. The transfer policies, as they pertain to the movement of \\nofficers and sergeants into and from specialized positions, shall appl y to all officers and \\nsergeants other than those exempted therefrom under the Program.  \\n3. Under the Program, a maximum number of officers and sergeants who, because of \\ninjury, are temporarily restricted by a physician from performing Patrol functions, shall \\nbe exempted from the requirement in the Officer and Sergeants’ Transfer Policies of \\nrotating into a Patrol assignment before and after holding a specialized assignment. \\nFor purposes of the Program, such officers and sergeants shall be referred to as \\n“exempt  officers or sergeants ,” or “officers or sergeants subject to the Program.”  \\n \\n4. When an officer or sergeant is first injured and temporarily restricted from performing \\nthe essential job duties of his or her position, including but not limited to the functions  \\nof an arrest, but is otherwise released to return to work, the Department shall attempt \\nto accommodate that officer or sergeant within the officer’s or sergeant’s bureau of origin \\nfor up to 120 calendar days.

The number of exempt officers and sergeants shall be determined by an analysis of  the \\nDepartment’s ability to function effectively considering th e inability of such officers and \\nsergeants to be assigned to a Patrol position. However, the maximum number of exempt \\npositions in the Program shall be  twenty (2 0) positions.  Of these twenty (2 0) positions \\nup to five (5) positions shall be designated for sergeants who  participate in the Program.   \\nSuch factors as total number of officers and sergeants, budgetary considerations, law \\nenforcement priorities, past experience, and other relevant criteria, shall be considered. \\nShould the Chief of Police determine that the maximum number of exempt officers or \\nsergeants should be changed, the requirements of City Charter Section 1111 (meet and \\nconfer with interest arbitration, if necessary) shall apply. Nothing in the Program prevents \\nan interim determination, should  drastic changes in staffing resulting from budgetary \\ncuts, or other economic situations, occur.  \\n 6. The Department shall maintain a list of designated positions as determined by the Chief  \\nof Police within the Department up to the maximum number of exempt positions within \\nthe Program. The list of designated exempt positions shall be organized based on the \\noperational need of the Department, as designated by the Chief of Police. All such \\npositions shall be administrative in nature and characterized by  the fact that they do not \\nrequire an officer or sergeant to be able to perform the essential job duties of his or her \\nposition, including but not limited to the functions of an arrest.  \\n 7. Exempt positions shall be filled in order of priority, based on th e operational needs of  the \\nDepartment, as designated by the Chief of Police. Once in the Program, Exempt Officers \\nand Sergeants shall be assigned based on this priority designation. Once assigned to a \\nposition, the Exempt Officer or Sergeant shall remain i n that assignment until such time \\nas: \\na. he or she is released to full duty;  \\nb. his or her work restrictions change such that they can perform the essential \\nfunctions of a patrol assignment;  \\nc. his or her work restrictions change such that the Department can no longer \\naccommodate them;  \\nd. the D epartment’s operational needs change; or \\ne. the officer or sergeant exceeds the maximum duration in the Program as \\noutlined in Section 1 2 below.  \\n8.   The Program is intended to apply only to officers and sergeants who are tempora rily \\nrestricted from performing the essential job duties of his or her position by a physician, \\nincluding the forcible arrest function. An officer or sergeant subject to the Program who \\nrecovers to the extent that he or she is no longer medically restricte d from performing \\nthe essential job duties of their position, including the arrest function, and is cleared for \\nfull-duty Patrol activities, shall be reassigned to a Patrol or other full -duty position.

The number of positions subject to the Exempt Off icers ’ and Sergeant’s Modified Duty  \\nProgram shall not exceed the maximum number described in paragraph 5 above. \\nShould the number of exempt officers or sergeants equal that maximum  number and \\nshould an additional officer or sergeant sustain injuries that w ould otherwise qualify for \\ninclusion in the Program, the following procedure shall apply: When it appears likely that \\nan officer or sergeant will qualify for the Program, the Department shall evaluate all the \\nofficers or sergeants subject to the Program to  determine if there is a likelihood that, \\nthrough retirement or recovery, a vacancy within the Program will exist. If there is no \\nlikelihood of a vacancy, the Department shall make an announcement requesting a \\nvolunteer to vacate his or her position within  the Program. In case of multiple volunteers, \\nthe officer or sergeant with the highest City seniority, i.e. highest amount of total time \\naccrued in all classes in the Classified Service, prevails. Should an officer or sergeant \\nvolunteer to vacate his or he r position within the Program, that officer or sergeant may \\nexhaust his or her remaining accumulated sick time, vacation time, or compensatory \\ntime (integration time) pending an application for retirement. Should that volunteer \\nofficer or sergeant exhaust all integration time and not retire or separate from City \\nservice, the Department shall notify said officer or sergeant to either return to full -duty \\nstatus or be separated from City service. Should the volunteer apply for a disability \\nretirement, the Depa rtment shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does \\nnot have a position available f or this volunteer because of the volunteer’s physical \\nrestrictions and lack of available Program positions. The Department shall assign the \\nofficer or sergeant  becoming subject to the Program to one of the vacant positions. \\nShould no officers or sergeants volunteer to vacate his or her position, the injured officer \\nor sergeant shall be required to use any  available leaves, including  accumulated  sick, \\nvacation, or compensatory time (integration time).  Once that officer or sergeant’s \\navailable integration time has been used, and if no positions within the Program are then \\navailable, the officer or sergeant may exhaust any other leave entitlements.  Once all \\npaid leave entitlements have been exhausted, the officer or sergeant may be granted \\nan unpaid leave of absence as a form of reasonable accommodation, pursuant to the \\nMemorandum of Agreement between the City and the San Jose Police Officers’ \\nAssoc iation , while waiting for assignment to a vacant position in the Program. If after \\nexhaustion of all paid and unpaid leave there is no vacant position in the Program the \\nofficer or sergeant shall be notified by the Department to immediately return to full -duty \\nor may be separated from City service. Should the officer or sergeant apply for disability \\nretirement, the Department shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does \\nnot have a position available for this officer or sergeant because of the officer ’s or \\nsergeant ’s physical restrictions and lack of available Progra m positions.  \\n10. Should there be multiple officers or sergeants injured and a vacancy becomes available \\nin the Program, officers or sergeants shall be accepted into the Program in order of \\ndate of eligibility for entry into the Program, with the earliest date of entry into the \\nProgram being assigned first. If the entry dates are the same, then City seniority will \\ndetermine which officer or sergeant will enter the Program first.  \\n11.

Officers or sergeants subject to \\nthe Exempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program shall be limited to  \\nparticipation in a Program position for a maximum of two (2) calendar years, or  \\nearlier if the employee’s work restrictions have been deemed permanent and stationary. \\nApproximately ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the two -year calendar term in \\nthe Program, the Department will notify the officer of the upcoming expiration and will \\ndiscuss options as set forth in paragraph 13 below.  \\n13. Program. Once an officer or sergeant has participated in the Exempt Officers’ and \\nSergeants’ Modified Duty Program position for  two (2) calendar  years, or earlier if  the \\nemployee’s work restrictions have been deemed permanent and stationary,  the \\nDepartment will consider and discuss with the exempt officer or sergeant the following \\noptions:  \\na. returning the member to full -duty with or without reasonable accommodation;  \\nb. engaging the member in the interactive process ;  \\nc. using available paid leave, FMLA /CFRA  leave, or absence through the \\nworkers’ compensation system, if applicable;  \\nd. recommending disability retirement;  \\ne. providing an unpaid leave of absence under the City’s Memorandum of  \\nAgreement with the SJPOA;  \\nf. employees with permanent and stationary restrictions who cannot be provided \\na reasonable accommodation  are required to submit for a disability retirement \\nwithin 30 days of the conclusion of the interactive process ; \\ng. initiating voluntary separation if none of the foregoing  options are appropriate.  \\n \\nIf an employee in the program has applied for a disability retirement within 30 days from \\nthe effective date of the implementation of this Program  and the disability retirement  is \\npending determination by the Police and Fire Retirement Board , the maximum time in \\nthe program , under section 1 2, above, shall be extended until the Police and Fire \\nRetirement Board makes a determination  of the employee’s disability retirement \\napplication .

The Department promotes officers to the rank of sergeant and sergeants to \\nthe rank of lieutenant, in compliance with civil service rules, from an eligibility list \\ncreated through a comp etitive examination.

In \\nthis example, if the employee does not have available sick leave \\nto use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick \\nleave and reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013, \\nto 50 hours, they will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of \\n50 hours, regardless of any sick leave accru ed after June 22, \\n2013.

Practical - The Voluntary Phase is nearly identical to the PAY CAR Program, which was being \\nused by the Administrative Unit \\n \\n3. Effective - Strategic, Long Term, with the advent of eResource \\n \\n4. This Mandatory Overtime Policy will expire; either at the time the Police Department is staffed \\nwith 1109 Officers or the Patrol Division is not experiencing a problem with filling patrol \\npositions. \\n \\n5. All voluntary overtime shifts worked  as part of this program will be for pay only. Mandatory \\nshifts worked as part of this program will be for pay or compensatory time, as determined by the \\nOfficer. \\n \\nII. The Bidding Process \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The First Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is VOLUNTARY \\n\\uf0b7 The Second Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is VOLUNTARY \\n\\uf0b7 The Third Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is MANDATORY \\n\\uf0b7 The Bidding cycle will cover approximately 3 months \\n\\uf0b7 The Third Phase (Mandatory) of the bidding process will only occur if there are unfilled pay car \\npositions at the conclusion of the First and Second Phases (Voluntary) as designated by the \\nBFO Administrative Unit \\n \\n1. First “Voluntary Phase” (Voluntary) \\n \\nAt the beginning of each bidding cycle, the BFO Administrative Unit will: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Determine the number of voluntary back-fill pay cars that Officers need to volunteer for to \\nexempt them from the mandatory phase of the cycle (See Section V below). \\n \\n\\uf0b7 The above number will be based on the total number of pay cars available and the number \\nof full duty Officers eligible to work at the time.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Back-fill pay cars will be offered to Officers in order of seniority starting from the most senior \\nto the most junior, based on departmental seniority. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Determine the maximum number of voluntary back-fill pay cars that will be offered to each \\nofficer for that cycle   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 An Officer can choose to work any shift that is open and is not required to stay on his or her \\nnormal shift. \\n ', metadata={}),\n",

The Officer will numerically rank the mandatory overtime shifts in descending \\norder to reflect the shifts they would prefer to work the most. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 eResource will assign Officers their mandatory overtime shifts based on their departmental \\nseniority and, if possible, the identified preferences for the days they would most like work. \\nThe BFO Administrative Unit cannot guarantee that every Officer will get their first choice. \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Officers who have scheduled time off will be exempted from the Mandatory Assignment \\nPhase during their time off (See Section III below). \\n \\nExample:  \\n  \\n1. The BFO Administrative Unit determines there is a need for 50 back-fill pay cars during the \\nscheduling cycle. \\n \\n2. During the Phase One and Phase Two bidding process (Voluntary), eResource will be \\nutilized to allow Officers to volunteer to work as many of the back-fill pay cars as they like up \\nto 30 hours per week (See Duty Manual Sections C1540-C1541). \\n \\n3. If an Officer volunteers for the number of back-fill pay cars required to exempt themselves \\nduring the voluntary bidding process, they will not be required to participate in the Phase \\nTwo bidding process (Mandatory).  \\n \\n4. If 40 of the 50 available pay car positions are filled during the voluntary bidding process, 10 \\nwould be left to fill during the mandatory bidding process.  \\n \\n5. 10 Officers will be mandated to fill the remaining 10 pay car positions by reverse seniority.  \\n \\n6. The bidding process will take two weeks to complete and will include one week for the BFO \\nAdministrative Unit to find replacements if they need to before the first back-fill pay car is \\nstarted in the next cycle. \\n \\n \\nIII. Specifics about the Mandatory Phase \\n \\n1. A reverse seniority process will be created for each day of the week. Officers may only be \\nmandated to work the shift he or she is currently working, except Officers working day shift may \\nbe mandated to work the swing shift.  \\n \\n2. eResource will account for which Officers are on pre-planned time-off (vacation, time off, FMLA, \\netc.) and Officers will not be scheduled during those times with the following guidelines \\n ', metadata={}),\n",

If there are remaining slots which need to be filled during the “Mandatory Phase” eResource will \\nidentify Officers with the least amount of seniority to fill those slots.  (i.e., if there are 5 slots that \\nneed to be filled through the “Mandatory Assignment Phase” the 5 Officers with the least \\nseniority, that have not previously been taken off the list during that list cycle, will be assigned).  \\n \\n4. The five Officers who were mandated to work will not be mandated to work again until the rest \\nof the “reverse seniority list” is exhausted. \\n \\n5. Every officer will eventually get mandated to work, unless they have been taken off of the \\n“Mandatory List” because they volunteered for the required amount of pay cars to exempt them.  \\nOfficers will be given a minimum two weeks’ notice when they are mandated to work a pay car.   \\n \\n6. If an officer cannot work his/her mandated overtime shift due to a hardship, the BFO \\nAdministrative Unit is responsible for finding their replacement.  If an officer trades away their \\nmandatory shift, calls in sick for their mandatory shift or cannot work it for any other reason, they \\nwill remain on the mandatory list until they actually work a mandatory shift. \\n \\n7. No officer will work more than 3 mandatory shifts within two pay periods. \\n \\n8. All overtime policies will be enforced (specifically C1540 & C1541), unless otherwise specified \\nherein.  For example, if an Officer works day shift with FSS off, he/she will not be mandated to \\nwork a midnight shift on Sunday (violation of the maximum 16 hours in a 24 hour period – \\nC1541). \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Department members shall not work in excess of thirty (30) hours of secondary \\nemployment assignments in one calendar week.

Frequently Asked Questions \\n \\n1. What if I have to work a mandatory shift on a Sunday on 3rd Watch and I have to be back at work on \\nMonday morning for my regular shift? \\n \\nOfficers can volunteer to work any shift during the Voluntary Phase. Additionally, Officers can be \\nmandated to work the shift he or she is currently working, and Officers working day shift may be \\nmandated to work the swing shift. Since a day shift Officer will not be mandated to work a midnight \\nshift, he or she will have ample time off between a mandatory day or swing shift and his or her regular \\nstart time.  \\n \\n2. What if I can’t work my mandatory overtime shift due to a hardship? \\n \\nIf an Officer cannot work his/her mandated overtime shift due to a hardship, the Administrative \\nUnit is responsible for finding a replacement.  If an Officer trades away his/her mandatory shift, \\ncalls in sick for their mandatory shift or cannot work it for any other reason, he/she will remain \\non the mandatory list until he/she completes a mandatory shift.   \\n \\n3. If I am on vacation for a month and am unable to work any mandatory overtime, will I have to make \\nup my missed dates? \\n \\nNo.  If an Officer has scheduled time off, he/she will not be subjected to mandatory overtime for \\ntheir scheduled vacation period.  \\n \\n4. What if I work other pay jobs (airport, schools, etc.) on my days off?  How can I fulfill my mandatory \\novertime obligations? \\n \\nMandatory overtime takes precedence over all other pay jobs. However, an Officer working a \\npre-scheduled Airport Assignment will not be mandated to work a mandatory assignment on \\nthat day but will still be subject to mandatory assignments on other days for which they are \\navailable. The Airport pay car schedule is incorporated into eResource. \\n \\n5. If Officers are required to work a mandatory overtime shift, will they have the option to take it for pay \\nor compensatory time? \\n \\nAll voluntary overtime shifts) as part of this program will be for pay only.  \\nMandatory Shifts worked as part of this program will be for pay or compensatory time, as \\ndetermined by the Officer.  \\n \\n6. What if I am sick on the day of my mandatory overtime shift? \\n \\nIt will be up to the Watch Commander / Briefing Sergeant to attempt to fill that specific spot of \\nthe sick officer.  The Officer will NOT have to take any of his or her sick hours for that specific \\nday.  The sick officer will continue to be on the list in order to make up the scheduled overtime \\nshift missed. \\n \\n ', metadata={}),\n",

To this end,  it \\nhas established  this policy  to regulate  the transfer of sergeants  between  assignments  throughout  \\nthe Department.  The Department has formed  an advisory committee,  known  as the “Personnel  \\nAdvisory  Committee”  (PAC) to assist  in policy  development  which  shall be beneficial  to the \\nDepartment and to the individual  Sergeant.  The PAC  does not have  the power  to alter \\nDepartment policy.  \\n \\nThe purpose of this document  is to establish a “Sergeants’  Transfer Policy”  for the rank of \\nSergeant.  The “Sergeants’  Transfer  Policy” affects the San Jose Police  Department’s four (4) \\nBureaus  (BFO/BOI/BOA/BTS)  as well as assignments which fall under the purview of the \\nOffice of the Chief of Police .

This does not apply to crimes \\nin progress or other circumstances that would allow the Park Ranger to be lawfully present without \\na warrant. \\nVICTIM AND WITNESS STATEMENTS \\nWhen conducting an investigation, the Park Ranger shall attempt to record the victim or witness \\nstatement with the BWC. The recording may be valuable evidence that contributes to or \\ncomplements an investigation. While evidence collection is important, the Department also \\nrecognizes it is important for Park Rangers to maintain credibility with people wanting to share \\ninformation. \\nShould a Park Ranger encounter a reluctant victim or witness who does not wish to make a \\nstatement on camera, the Park Ranger shall use discretion and not record the victim or witness \\nstatement with the BWC, but document on camera the reason for not fully recording the statement \\nwith the BWC. The BWC should be reactivated as soon as practicable after the victim or witness \\nstatement is provided. \\nUNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE \\nAll BWC recordings shall remain the property of the Department and constitute official records of \\ninvestigation of the Department. \\nUnauthorized access to, use, duplication, and/or distribution of BWC files is prohibited. Park \\nRangers shall not make copies of any BWC file for their personal use and are prohibited from \\nusing a recording device such as a phone camera or secondary video camera to record BWC \\nfiles.', metadata={}),\n",

The Park Ranger will submit a request for deletion via email, with sufficient information \\nto locate the BWC file, to their direct supervisor. \\nThe email will be forwarded through the Park Ranger’s chain of command to their Supervising \\nPark Ranger.

In this example, if the employee does not have available sick leave to \\nuse that was  accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick lea ve and reduces their sick \\nleave balance on June 22, 2013, to 80 0 hour s, they will only be en titled to a sick leave \\npayout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013.

The City and San Jose Police Officers ’ Association (SJPOA) recognize that, despite best \\nefforts to promote safety, police officers and sergeants are injured in the line of duty. Such \\ninjuries are unfortunate but can be a consequence of police work. The Exempt Officers ’ \\nand Sergeants ’ Modified Duty Program (“Program ”) is available to any police officer or \\nsergeant that has work -related or non -work related injuries or illnesses which preclude \\nhim or her from performing the f ull scope of his or her duties without accommodation.  \\n2. The City and SJPOA recognize that police officers and sergeants exist to enforce the law \\nand protect public safety. Some essential job duties of a police officer and sergeant \\ninclude, but are not limite d to, engaging in physically strenuous tasks, such as making \\nforcible arrests, pursuing fleeing suspects, responding to mass celebrations and \\ndemonstrations, and responding to emergency situations.  \\n3. The City and SJPOA recognize that officers and sergeants w ith physical restrictions can \\nrepresent a valuable resource to the Police Department. Given the training and \\nexperience obtained by and invested in police officers and sergeants, the Police \\nDepartment can benefit from the knowledge and experience of office rs and sergeants \\nwith physical restrictions.  \\n4. The Program is intended to provide temporary modified duty assignments for officers or \\nsergeants with temporary work restrictions until the officer or sergeant is returned to full -\\nduty status or meets the maximu m duration of participation in the Program as outlined \\nbelow.  \\n5. The City and SJPOA recognize the legitimate interest of the San Jose Police Department \\nin maximizing the number of officers and sergeants available for Patrol duties, and other \\nphysically strenuous activities. The responsibilities of the Police Department are largely \\nphysical, involving suppression of criminal activity and exhibiting levels of force necessary \\nto control dangerous and unruly situations. Emergency situations also m ay require the \\nDepartment to provide a large uniformed presence. Additionally, at any particular time, \\nbecause of short -term disabilities, sick leave, military leave, training missions, family \\nleave, and the like, in addition to those in the Program, offic ers and sergeants are \\nunavailable for Patrol activities, reducing the actual level of officers and sergeants who \\nmay participate in Patrol assignments on a day -to-day basis. While the Department \\nrecognizes that non -physical assignments represent necessary and valuable aspects of \\npolice work, the philosophy of the Department is clearly Patrol -oriented. The first and \\nmain duty of the Department is the visible protection of the public. Because of these \\nprinciples, the parties recognize that the Department has a legitimate interest in limiting \\nthe number of officers and sergeants on the force who are physically unable to perform \\nthe strenuous physical activities necessary in a Patrol assignment. A goal of the Program \\nis to strike a balance between the business n eeds of the Department and the interests of \\ninjured officers and sergeants in meaningful employment in a temporary modified duty \\nassignment. Additionally, nothing in the Program requires the City of San Jose to change \\nits policies and procedures regarding the recruiting and hiring of police officers to entry -\\nlevel employment .

The City and SJPOA recognize that the administration of the Police Department \\ncontinues to change over time, based on budget, staffing, criminal justice priorities, \\nnegotiated terms an d conditions of employment, and numerous other factors. In view of \\nthe fluid nature of the organization, the parties intend to provide for flexibility in \\nadministering this Program, and recognize that changes in circumstances may require \\nchanges in the Pro gram beyond the provisions contemplated herein. The Police \\nDepartment is committed to periodic review of positions within the Department, with a \\nview toward inclusion of positions in the Program. A goal of the Program is to provide for \\nflexibility in admin istering the Program to facilitate changed circumstances and maximum \\ninclusion of positions, given the interests of the Department and its officers and sergeants.  \\n7. The City and SJPOA recognize an employer’s and its employees ’ obligations under the \\nAmericans  with Disabilities Act and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.  \\n8. The purpose of the Program is to provide a temporary modified duty Program for officers \\nand sergeants with temporary work restrictions.  \\nSince this Program is to provide temporary modified duty, officers and sergeants with \\npermanent work restrictions are not eligible for the Program except as otherwise provided \\nherein. The City will engage in the interactive process with officers and sergea nts with \\npermanent work restrictions .  \\nPROCEDURES  \\n1. Claims regarding the interpretation and application of the specific terms of this Program  \\nshall be grievable under the  Memorandum of Agreement between the City and the San \\nJose Police Officers’ Association , with the exception of any claim that the provisions of \\nthe Program  violate state or federal law.  \\n2. Nothing in the Program affects the provisions as negotiated in the Officer s’ Transfer \\nPolicy or the Sergeants’ Transfer Policy with respect to officers and sergeants not \\ncovered by this Program. The transfer policies, as they pertain to the movement of \\nofficers and sergeants into and from specialized positions, shall appl y to all officers and \\nsergeants other than those exempted therefrom under the Program.  \\n3. Under the Program, a maximum number of officers and sergeants who, because of \\ninjury, are temporarily restricted by a physician from performing Patrol functions, shall \\nbe exempted from the requirement in the Officer and Sergeants’ Transfer Policies of \\nrotating into a Patrol assignment before and after holding a specialized assignment. \\nFor purposes of the Program, such officers and sergeants shall be referred to as \\n“exempt  officers or sergeants ,” or “officers or sergeants subject to the Program.”  \\n \\n4. When an officer or sergeant is first injured and temporarily restricted from performing \\nthe essential job duties of his or her position, including but not limited to the functions  \\nof an arrest, but is otherwise released to return to work, the Department shall attempt \\nto accommodate that officer or sergeant within the officer’s or sergeant’s bureau of origin \\nfor up to 120 calendar days.

Of these twenty (2 0) positions \\nup to five (5) positions shall be designated for sergeants who  participate in the Program.   \\nSuch factors as total number of officers and sergeants, budgetary considerations, law \\nenforcement priorities, past experience, and other relevant criteria, shall be considered. \\nShould the Chief of Police determine that the maximum number of exempt officers or \\nsergeants should be changed, the requirements of City Charter Section 1111 (meet and \\nconfer with interest arbitration, if necessary) shall apply.

Exempt positions shall be filled in order of priority, based on th e operational needs of  the \\nDepartment, as designated by the Chief of Police.

If there is no \\nlikelihood of a vacancy, the Department shall make an announcement requesting a \\nvolunteer to vacate his or her position within  the Program. In case of multiple volunteers, \\nthe officer or sergeant with the highest City seniority, i.e. highest amount of total time \\naccrued in all classes in the Classified Service, prevails. Should an officer or sergeant \\nvolunteer to vacate his or he r position within the Program, that officer or sergeant may \\nexhaust his or her remaining accumulated sick time, vacation time, or compensatory \\ntime (integration time) pending an application for retirement. Should that volunteer \\nofficer or sergeant exhaust all integration time and not retire or separate from City \\nservice, the Department shall notify said officer or sergeant to either return to full -duty \\nstatus or be separated from City service. Should the volunteer apply for a disability \\nretirement, the Depa rtment shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does \\nnot have a position available f or this volunteer because of the volunteer’s physical \\nrestrictions and lack of available Program positions. The Department shall assign the \\nofficer or sergeant  becoming subject to the Program to one of the vacant positions. \\nShould no officers or sergeants volunteer to vacate his or her position, the injured officer \\nor sergeant shall be required to use any  available leaves, including  accumulated  sick, \\nvacation, or compensatory time (integration time).  Once that officer or sergeant’s \\navailable integration time has been used, and if no positions within the Program are then \\navailable, the officer or sergeant may exhaust any other leave entitlements.  Once all \\npaid leave entitlements have been exhausted, the officer or sergeant may be granted \\nan unpaid leave of absence as a form of reasonable accommodation, pursuant to the \\nMemorandum of Agreement between the City and the San Jose Police Officers’ \\nAssoc iation , while waiting for assignment to a vacant position in the Program. If after \\nexhaustion of all paid and unpaid leave there is no vacant position in the Program the \\nofficer or sergeant shall be notified by the Department to immediately return to full -duty \\nor may be separated from City service. Should the officer or sergeant apply for disability \\nretirement, the Department shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does \\nnot have a position available for this officer or sergeant because of the officer ’s or \\nsergeant ’s physical restrictions and lack of available Progra m positions.  \\n10.

It is the sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the Guardians must protect Rocket (Cooper) from the High Evolutionary (Iwuji).\\nGunn stated in November 2014 that he had initial ideas for a third and final film in the series, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017. Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn\\'s return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on The Suicide Squad (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series Peacemaker (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success. The film received praise for Gunn\\'s direction and screenplay, its visuals, soundtrack, performances, action sequences, emotional weight and humor; many deemed the film as a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere, the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha, who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her. After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula, and flees. The Guardians\\' med-packs are useless at healing Rocket\\'s wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by the High Evolutionary, Rocket\\'s creator. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp\\'s headquarters to find the switch\\'s override code and save Rocket\\'s life.\\nAs Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. As a baby, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket\\'s growing intelligence but became furious once it exceeded his own. The High Evolutionary used Rocket to perfect his Humanimal creations, then planned to harvest Rocket\\'s brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket eventually fled Counter-Earth in a spaceship.\\nIn the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora, help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket\\'s file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary\\'s advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race\\'s creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Arête Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket as Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to Arête. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot enter Arête, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill\\'s group. Gamora saves Rocket from being captured by Adam and the High Evolutionary\\'s guard War Pig.\\nQuestioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits disillusionment with Counter-Earth’s imperfect society, so he destroys the planet, killing the Humanimals as well as Ayesha. Arête departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax and Mantis boarding to rescue Quill and Groot, who instead escape Arête with Theel, who they kill, before retrieving the code from his corpse and being rescued by Gamora in their ship. As Quill\\'s group uses the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience, in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. He learns from Lylla that his time has not yet come, as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and restart Rocket\\'s heart.\\nDrax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter several genetically modified humanoid children on Arête before being captured. The other Guardians stage a rescue mission, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary\\'s forces. Kraglin fires on Arête with Knowhere, dooming Arête, then helps to save Knowhere\\'s citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary\\'s Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary\\'s crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill\\'s group. The Guardians delay leaving Arête, choosing to rescue the Star Children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo\\'s telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, who the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary, and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over, but is saved by Adam, who had a change of heart when Groot saved him from Arête.\\nIn the aftermath, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as Captain, and travels to Earth to reunite with Jason, his grandfather. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.\\nIn a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued Star Children), and Adam\\'s pet Blurp, take on a new mission. \\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\nChris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:The half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers, the Ravagers. In the film, Quill is in a \"state of depression\" following the appearance of a variant of his dead lover Gamora, who does not share the same affection for Quill as her older version had for him, which in turn affects his leadership of the Guardians.\\nZoe Saldaña as Gamora:An orphan who seeks redemption for her past crimes, and was adopted and trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin. The original version of Gamora, a member of the Guardians, was killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and an alternate version of the character traveled to the present in Avengers: Endgame (2019); Saldaña reprises the latter role in this film, now serving as a member of the Ravagers. Saldaña stated that Vol. 3 would be the final time she would portray Gamora, noting that she originally signed to play her in one film and ended up playing the role for much longer, a role she was grateful to play due to the impact it especially had on female fans.\\nDave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:A member of the Guardians and a highly skilled warrior whose family was slaughtered by Ronan the Accuser, under the instructions of Thanos. Bautista stated that Vol. 3 would be the final time he would portray Drax, having been grateful for the role, while still calling it a \"relief\" to have concluded his time with the character, given the long hours needed to get into makeup and hoping to pursue more dramatic acting roles. Because of Bautista\\'s decision, Gunn opted not to include Drax in the post-credits scene.\\nKaren Gillan as Nebula:A member of the Guardians, a former Avenger, and Gamora\\'s adoptive sister who, similarly to her, was trained by their adoptive father Thanos to be his personal assassin. Gillan believed Nebula was developing into a \"slightly different person\" with more levity as she starts to heal psychologically following the death of Thanos, who was the source of her abuse and torment. Vol. 3 fulfills a character arc for the character writer and director James Gunn envisioned when starting work on Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), going from a minor villain to a member of the Guardians. Although the film teases a possible romance between Star-Lord and Nebula, Gunn denies having ever considered the two becoming a couple, though Gillan does believe she harbors a small crush on Quill.\\nPom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers, and Quill\\'s half-sister.\\nVin Diesel as the voice of Groot: A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket. Austin Freeman provided the motion-capture for Groot.\\nBradley Cooper as Rocket:A member of the Guardians and a former Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter and a master of weapons and military tactics. Gunn said that the film tells Rocket\\'s story, including his background and \"where he\\'s going\", along with how that ties into the other Guardians and the end of this iteration of the team. The film completes a character arc that was established in Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), and continued in Infinity War and Endgame. Sean Gunn once again provided on set motion capture for the character, while also voicing young Rocket. Cooper also voiced adolescent Rocket while Noah Raskin voiced baby Rocket.\\nWill Poulter as Adam Warlock:A powerful artificial being created by the Sovereign to destroy the Guardians. Given Warlock is newly born from the Sovereign\\'s cocoon, he is \"basically a baby\" that \"does not understand life very well\". Poulter believed there was \"a lot of comedy\" in someone just entering the world for the first time and \"trying to develop his moral compass\", while also having \"some genuine pathos\". Gunn thought Warlock\\'s interactions with the Guardians provided \"an interesting juxtaposition\" to what their journey has been, and described him as a more traditional superhero compared to the Guardians, although not necessarily a hero.\\nSean Gunn as Kraglin: A member of the Guardians and Yondu Udonta\\'s former second-in-command in the Ravagers.\\nChukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary:An alien cyborg scientist and CEO of OrgoCorp specializing in creating hybrid creatures and Rocket\\'s creator, seeking to forcibly enhance all living beings into a \"special race\" where he has been credited as creating the Animen, the Humanimals, the Hell Spawn, the Sovereign, the Xeronians, and the Star Children. Iwuji described the character as \"narcissistic, sociopathic, but very charming\", adding that there was \"something very Shakespearean about him, there\\'s something very emotionally dark about him, and he\\'s a lot of fun on top of all that\". In preparation for the role, Iwuji listened to his character\\'s taste for classical music in contrast to the American rock and pop music songs played in the film, allowing Iwuji to go back to his favorite arias and operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\\'s The Marriage of Figaro (1786) and Don Giovanni (1787). Gunn likened the High Evolutionary to \"a space version\" of Doctor Moreau from Island of Lost Souls (1932), a film Gunn is a big fan of, calling him \"a detestable character\". When asked by Rachel Lindsay of Extra about the character, Gunn referred to the High Evolutionary as the \"cruelest MCU villain\" to date the franchise has ever seen due to how he negatively impacts on the lives of Rocket and his fellow subject friends, while Iwuji made sure along with Gunn to avoid giving the Evolutionary, at least intentionally, any sympathy unlike previous villains like Thanos or Killmonger, focusing under Gunn\\'s orders on commenting in the character\\'s single mindedness, narcissistic and zealous personality like the \"most horrific\" figures in history have been shown to be.\\nLinda Cardellini as Lylla: An anthropomorphic otter who is an associate and friend of Rocket. Cardellini provided both the voice and motion capture for Lylla, having previously played Laura Barton in past MCU media.\\nNathan Fillion as Master Karja: An orgosentry at Orgocorp.\\nSylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord: A high-ranking Ravager.Reprising their respective roles from previous Guardians films and/or The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022) are Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people who had Adam Warlock created to destroy the Guardians; Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, a high-ranking Ravager; Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck; Christopher Fairbank as the Broker; Stephen Blackehart and Rhett Miller as Steemie and Bzermikitokolok, two denizens of Knowhere; Gregg Henry as Quill\\'s grandfather Jason; and Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, the former head of the Ravagers and Peter\\'s deceased mentor. Maria Bakalova reprises her voice and motion capture role from the Holiday Special as Cosmo, a member of the Guardians who is a sapient dog that developed psionic abilities after being abandoned in outer space by the Soviet Union. Gunn changed Cosmo\\'s gender from male, as depicted in the comics, to female for the film, as a tribute to the character\\'s original inspiration, Laika, a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space. Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Slate, after also doing so for the Holiday Special, and was previously portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two Guardians films. Tara Strong (who voiced Miss Minutes in the Disney+ series Loki) voices Mainframe who was previously voiced by an uncredited Miley Cyrus in Vol. 2. Jared Gore provides motion capture for Krugarr, a Ravager who wields sorcery powers and speaks through his sorcery.Asim Chaudhry voices Teefs, an anthropomorphic walrus; Mikaela Hoover (who played Nova Prime\\'s assistant in the first film) voices Floor, an anthropomorphic rabbit; Daniela Melchior appears as Ura, the receptionist at Orgocorp; Miriam Shor and Nico Santos appear as Recorder Vim and Recorder Theel, respectively, the scientifically-minded henchmen of the High Evolutionary; Jennifer Holland appears as Administrator Kwol, a security employee of Orgocorp; Kai Zen appears as Phyla, one of the High Evolutionary\\'s Star Child prisoners; Judy Greer (who played Maggie Lang in the first two Ant-Man films) voices War Pig, a cyborg pig and member of the Hell Spawns working for the High Evolutionary; Reinaldo Faberlle voices Behemoth, a cyborg bird and member of the Hell Spawns who also works for the High Evolutionary; Dee Bradley Baker voices Blurp, a furry F\\'saki that is an unnamed Ravager\\'s pet; and Dane DiLiegro appears as an Humanimal octopus drug dealer on Counter-Earth (credited as \"Unsavory Octopus\").Cameos in the film include Lloyd Kaufman as Gridlemop, a Krylorian on Knowhere who partakes in a card game with Kraglin; Pete Davidson as Phlektik, a guard at Arête Laboratories; and writer and director James Gunn as the voice of Lambshank, a deformed experiment of the High Evolutionary that is among those freed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.\\n\\n\\n== Production ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development ===\\n\\n\\n==== Initial work ====\\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014) writer and director James Gunn stated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the \"basic story\" for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film. Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third Guardians film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making Vol. 2. In April 2016, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, the producer of the Guardians films, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in \"2020 and beyond\". In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film \"for sure. We\\'re trying to figure it out\", soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it \"unless something goes horribly—which is always possible, you never know\". He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks\". Part of Gunn\\'s reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it without Michael Rooker, whose character from the first two films, Yondu Udonta, died at the end of Vol. 2.\\n\\nGunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He said the film would be set after Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and would \"conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond\". He also felt that the three Guardians films would \"work together as a whole\", telling one story, with the third film \"tying a lot of stuff together\" from the first two and giving \"a lot of answers on a lot of different things\". Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\". He was set to begin work on Vol. 3 shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant on Infinity War. On returning for the third film, Gunn said, \"I wouldn\\'t have said yes if I didn\\'t have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do. I\\'m not a guy that\\'s just going to do it if I don\\'t have a vision for it\".After originally including Adam Warlock in his script treatment for Vol. 2, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance in Vol. 3. In May 2017, after the release of Vol. 2, Gunn said he would be creating the third film \"over the next three years\", and confirmed that Pom Klementieff would reprise her role as Mantis. He also intended to have Elizabeth Debicki reprise her role as Ayesha. By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps). In September, Gunn reiterated that Vol. 3 would be released \"in a little under three years\", as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020. At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet with Mark Hamill about possibly appearing in the film. In April, Chris Pratt was set to reprise his role as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the following month, Dave Bautista confirmed that he would reprise his role as Drax the Destroyer. Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of official pre-production on the film.\\n\\n\\n==== Firing of James Gunn ====\\nOn July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn. This came after conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, began circulating old tweets he had made regarding controversial topics such as rape and pedophilia, and called for his firing. The Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn stated, \"The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James\\' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio\\'s values, and we have severed our business relationship with him\". While not part of the decision to fire Gunn, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger supported the \"unanimous decision\" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios. In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was \"making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo\" but felt as he has \"developed as a person, so has my work and my humor\". He continued, \"It\\'s not to say I\\'m better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it\\'s shocking and trying to get a reaction are over\". In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were \"totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative\", adding \"I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then\".\\nIn response to the firing, many of the Guardians cast members tweeted support for Gunn. Rooker decided to leave Twitter, while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures. The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actress Selma Blair and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, and inspired opinion pieces on the firing and how it would affect Hollywood from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and news organizations such as The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, Deadline Hollywood, and Forbes. On July 30, the cast of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, including Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Karen Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, \"We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss. In that time, we\\'ve been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of Volume 3 as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him\". Despite this and the notable \"vociferous support\" Gunn received, Variety reported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were \"unacceptable in the #MeToo era and are not in line with Disney\\'s family-friendly image\". Variety continued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such as Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, or the Russo brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new. In early August, Bautista said that he would fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn\\'s existing script.Disney and Marvel still wanted to \"move forward quickly\" on the film, and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn\\'s script. This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to \"complicated negotiations\" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement. Gunn was expected to be paid $7–10 million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, \"even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie\". Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him including Warner Bros. for their rival superhero franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began \"back channel conversations\" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way. This \"eleventh-hour\" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film\\'s cast. In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn\\'s talent agency for him to be given a second chance. Despite this and the reported \"civil and professional\" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney\\'s decision to fire Gunn.Later in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn. Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, with principal photography set for January or February 2019. At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would \"want to work for Disney\" given how they handled the firing of Gunn. In late September, James Gunn\\'s brother Sean, who played Kraglin Obfonteri and provided motion capture for Rocket in the previous Guardians films, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James\\'s script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue. Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother\\'s firing. At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider directing Vol. 3 after the success of his directorial debut A Star Is Born (2018), but said that he \"could never imagine\" directing a film that he did not write. By mid-October, James Gunn had completed his exit settlement with Disney and was set to write and potentially direct The Suicide Squad (2021) for Warner Bros / DC Films.\\n\\n\\n==== Rehiring Gunn ====\\nThe day after Gunn joined The Suicide Squad in mid-October 2018, he was privately notified by Horn that he could return as director for Vol. 3. This came after further meetings between the studios and Gunn. Horn had changed his mind after being impressed by Gunn\\'s response to the situation. Gunn discussed his commitments to The Suicide Squad with Feige, and production on Vol. 3 was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to complete The Suicide Squad first. In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script for Ant-Man (2015), Adam McKay said he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director for Vol. 3 with Feige, among other projects. In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still make Vol. 3, and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film. Deadline Hollywood stated that Marvel Studios had \"never met with or considered any other director\" for the film. By the end of April, the franchise\\'s five main stars—Pratt, Saldaña, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel—were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.Discussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket. Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as \"the same\". He had actually grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that an origin story for Rocket could justify what a Bugs Bunny-like \"goofy character\" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the \"seed\" of the trilogy. While Vol. 3 effectively reveals Rocket\\'s backstory through flashbacks akin to those from the story structure of The Godfather Part II (1974), Gunn initially considered to tell Rocket\\'s origins in a team-up movie between him and Groot without the other Guardians, but ultimately felt that he had to conclude Peter Quill\\'s story first and then focus on Rocket in a third Guardians-centric film. That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn\\'s return to the franchise. In June, Saldaña was asked about her role in the film after her character Gamora was killed in Infinity War, and she returned to play a younger version in Endgame who travels through time to the present. Saldaña said that Gamora\\'s fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have for Vol. 3, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as \"the most lethal woman in the galaxy\" as she has been referred to previously. Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel\\'s decision to kill Gamora in Infinity War and said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand. According to Infinity War and Endgame screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back in Endgame specifically so that Gunn could include her in Vol. 3, so Gunn found no complications over writing her character arc in Vol. 3 due to having been told in advance. In December, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with the Guardians characters, he would not have the character be resurrected. Gunn felt the stakes of a character\\'s death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead. Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \"nullify Yondu\\'s sacrifice\" in Vol. 2, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback; Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death\\'s meaning. In April, Gunn said the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect production plans for the film at that time, saying the next month that the film would be released \"a little after 2021\".In August 2020, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film\\'s script and began writing a spin-off television series from The Suicide Squad titled Peacemaker (2022). A month later, he was planning to begin work on Vol. 3 in 2021 after completing that film and series. He confirmed in November that the script for Vol. 3 was finished, and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks. The film was given a 2023 release date a month later, with filming set to begin in late 2021. Shortly after, it was revealed to also be set after The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022).\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-production ===\\nPre-production work creating the designs and visuals for the film began by April 2021. In early May, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on May 5, 2023. Later that month, Gunn said Vol. 3 would take place after the events of Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), which features several Guardians characters. That film concludes the storyline established in Endgame which sees Thor journey off with the Guardians. Gunn noted this ending was decided upon \"in editing\" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay for Vol. 3, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film. Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June, with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia for an expected end around April 2022. By then, Bautista said he had not read a script for Vol. 3 and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays. The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional and funny. She also felt it was Gunn\\'s \"strongest work yet\" with the Guardians characters. Gunn reiterated that the script had \"basically stayed the same\" from three years prior but he had been \"playing with it in little ways\" over the years. He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a \"heavier\" story than the previous films, with a more grounded approach that was inspired by The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker. An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film\\'s main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary. Gunn originally wrote a cameo appearance for Kumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios\\' Eternals (2021).By late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter. George MacKay was also on the shortlist and Regé-Jean Page was considered for the part. Poulter auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta. When first auditioning for Warlock, Poulter was unaware of who his character\\'s name was other than he had been teased at the post-credits scene of Vol. 2, but Marvel just described the role to him as \"an untitled character\" until Poulter was \"drip-fed\" with more information over and over until discovering how steeped Adam Warlock is in the source material. In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous Guardians films on a deeper level, while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula\\'s story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous Guardians films. Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October, and Gunn said \"dozens of roles\" had already been cast. Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \"wanted somebody who was youthful\" and would fit with Marvel Studios\\' future plans for the character. Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards. Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month, and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.\\n\\n\\n=== Filming ===\\nPrincipal photography began on November 8, 2021, at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, under the working title Hot Christmas. Henry Braham serves as cinematographer, after doing so for Vol. 2, The Suicide Squad,  and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn\\'s firing, and then in February 2021, before Gunn began work on Peacemaker. With the start of filming, Sylvester Stallone revealed that he would return as Stakar Ogord from Vol. 2, and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on Peacemaker. Iwuji\\'s screen test for the film was shot on the set of Peacemaker with that series\\' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the Vol. 3 set and crew to film Ezra Miller\\'s cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the Peacemaker season finale.Production designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for Vol. 3 after they did so with their work on The Suicide Squad. In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic\\'s StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big, believing they were larger than the sets used on The Suicide Squad. The interior of the Guardians\\' new ship, the Bowie, was a four-story set. Judianna Makovsky serves as costume designer. The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special was filmed at the same time as Vol. 3, from February to late April 2022, with the same main cast and sets. Gunn enjoyed being able to switch to filming the special after doing scenes for Vol. 3, given the tonal difference between the two with Vol. 3 being more \"emotional\", feeling it helped provide a \"relief\" to the actors as well, and called the Holiday Special shoot easier than Vol. 3. In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien. Shooting was also expected to occur in London, England, in late 2021. Vol. 3 is the first MCU film to feature the word \"fuck\" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill. The dialogue \"Open the fucking door\" was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn\\'s suggestion, though there was some consideration over giving the one-liner to Groot instead. Gunn mentioned that the Korean film The Villainess (2017) inspired one of the fight scenes in Vol. 3. Filming on Vol. 3 wrapped on May 6, 2022.\\n\\n\\n=== Post-production ===\\nIn early June 2022, Daniela Melchior was revealed to have a small role in the film, after previously starring in The Suicide Squad. Debicki was also confirmed to be reprising her role as Ayesha, while Maria Bakalova and Nico Santos were also revealed to be appearing in the film. In July, Iwuji and Bakalova were revealed to be portraying the High Evolutionary and Cosmo the Spacedog, respectively. Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two Guardians films, and Slate in the Holiday Special and Vol. 3. The following month, Michael Rosenbaum revealed that he had reprised his role as Martinex from Vol. 2 in the film. In October 2022, it was revealed that Bakalova would portray Cosmo in the Holiday Special ahead of her role in Vol. 3. In February 2023, Asim Chaudhry revealed he would appear in the film in an undisclosed role. In April 2023, Linda Cardellini was revealed to be voicing Lylla; she previously appeared in multiple MCU projects as Laura Barton, and starred as Velma Dinkley in the Gunn-written films Scooby-Doo (2002) and Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), as well as a cameo in the Gunn-written and directed Super (2010). Two days of reshoots occurred. In late April, Tara Strong revealed that she was cast in an undisclosed role. Strong was later revealed to have been cast as Mainframe, replacing Miley Cyrus from Vol. 2 due to Cyrus\\' unavailability.The visual effects were provided by Framestore, Weta FX, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Rodeo FX, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, BUF, Lola VFX, Perception, and Compuhire. Stephane Ceretti returns from the first film to serve as the visual effects supervisor, while Fred Raskin returns from the first two films to serve as the editor, alongside Greg D\\'Auria, who returns from the Holiday Special. Additional editing was provided by Tatiana S. Riegel.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\n\\nIn April 2017, Gunn felt the music for the film would be different from what was used for the first two films\\' soundtracks, Awesome Mix Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. The next month, he added that he was \"panicking\" about the soundtrack and had to make some \"pretty specific choices\" shortly due to the wider range of available music for the story, By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could grow again. All of the songs for the film had been selected by the following month; the songs are not modern and come from Quill\\'s Zune that he received at the end of Vol. 2, although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 1970s pop songs compared to the first two films, instead spanning multiple decades. Gunn was unable to use the song \"Russian Roulette\" by the Lords of the New Church for Vol. 3 due to a legal battle over its ownership. The film opens with an acoustic version of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, which provided \"a much different tone from the beginning than the other two films\". The film ends with \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machine, as Gunn is a fan of its album Lungs; he had thought about including the song to wrap-up the trilogy since he started writing Vol. 2.The track list for Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was revealed in April 2023, and was made available on Spotify and Apple Music on April 3 as part of a larger Guardians of the Galaxy: The Official Mixtape playlist, which also featured the soundtracks and scores from the previous two films. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 was released by Hollywood Records on CD and digital download on May 3, 2023, a 12\" 2-LP vinyl on May 5, and is set to release on cassette on July 7.In October 2021, Gunn revealed that John Murphy was composing the film\\'s score and had already recorded music to be played on set during filming. Murphy replaces Tyler Bates, who composed the score for the first two films. However, Bates\\' theme from the previous films were referenced; Murphy had also replaced Bates as composer of The Suicide Squad after Bates left that film during production. Murphy\\'s original score for the film was released digitally on May 3, 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Marketing ==\\nThe film was discussed during Marvel Studios\\' panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where the first footage was revealed. Iwuji was also announced as playing the High Evolutionary, appearing at the panel in costume. Gunn stated the footage was not released publicly because the visual effects were not complete enough for \"repeated views and close inspection\". An official trailer was released on December 1, 2022, during the CCXP. It featured \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog. Drew Taylor of TheWrap called the trailer a doozy, thrilling, and emotional, and stated that \"Gunn\\'s patented, rollicking \\'Guardians of the Galaxy\\' tone is very much in place\", and noted \"an undercurrent of extreme melancholy\". Carson Burton of Variety predicted from the trailer that the film would be \"shaping up to be an emotional ending\" by showing Rocket\\'s memories and Star-Lord missing Gamora. Jay Peters at The Verge said the trailer intrigued him as a \"wild ride across the stars\" with different planets.A second trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. It featured \"Since You Been Gone\" by Rainbow. Grant Hermanns of Screen Rant felt the trailer gave \"a deeper look\" at the film, particularly Adam Warlock\\'s powers as compared to his brief appearance in the first one. Hermanns also said the second trailer \"goes a step further in highlighting the emotional story\" after the first one \"efficiently set [the film\\'s] tone, featuring plenty of melancholic shots of the [Guardians of the Galaxy] facing the music\". The trailer accumulated 134.1 million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, and was the most-watched Super Bowl trailer in post-game day traffic according to RelishMix. It was also the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that a Super Bowl trailer exceeded 100 million views on social media in a 24-hour period.Disney and Marvel Music partnered with the music streaming service Spotify in May 2023, to promote the film. As part of the promotion, a playlist, titled the \"K-GOTG Radio Experience\", was created. Marvel Studios also promoted the film with General Mills limited-edition cereals and snacks, including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Lucky Charms, Trix, Reese\\'s Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Go-Gurt. Microsoft also partnered with Marvel Studios to promote the film with a limited-edition Zune MP3 player; a single non-functional model would be created using 3D printing and launched inside the International Space Station.\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\n\\n\\n=== Theatrical ===\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 had an early screening at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on April 19, 2023.

The site\\'s critics consensus reads: \"A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final Guardians of the Galaxy is a loving last hurrah for the MCU\\'s most ragtag family.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the previous two Guardians films, while PostTrak reported that moviegoers gave the film a 91% positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend it.The Independent found it was \"the best Marvel movie in years\" as did Vox and the CBC. In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \"the film\\'s saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\" Wendy Ide of The Observer lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the GOTG series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the Guardians USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\" Matt Singer from ScreenCrush praised the film for concluding Rocket\\'s arc story stating that \"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been his story all along — and with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance.\" Writing for The Verge, Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film\\'s action sequences and storyline and commented that \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon\\'s (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that\\'ve been haunting them since Endgame.\" The Hindustan Times praised Gunn\\'s direction and writing, commenting that \"As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can\\'t help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we\\'ve been on and foes we\\'ve faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots.\" Nathan Durr of CBS News praised the film\\'s soundtrack and stated that \"There\\'s no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters.\"A negative review from NPR criticized the approach of cruelty to animals in the film while The New York Times called it a \"dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film (that) may only be for completionist fans\", and the Chicago Tribune, \"the most empty, brutal MCU movie yet\". Conversely, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) declared the film to be \"the best animal rights film of the year\", and gave Gunn a \"Not a Number Award\" for his depiction of animal testing.\\n\\n\\n=== Accolades ===\\nCynthia Blondelle and Heather Kreamer were nominated at the 2023 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards for Best Music Supervision in a Trailer – Film. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 received nominations for Best Fantasy Adventure, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, and Best Teaser at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards. The Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3: Awesome Mix, Vol. 3 soundtrack is nominated for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 66th Grammy Awards.\\n\\n\\n== Documentary special ==\\n\\nIn February 2021, the documentary series Marvel Studios: Assembled was announced. The special on this film, Assembled: The Making of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, was released on Disney+ on September 13, 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\nGunn said in April 2017 that a fourth Guardians film could happen, though it would likely center on a new group of characters since Gunn planned to conclude the story of the current team in Vol. 3. Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another Guardians film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters. One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \"brilliant\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \"very interested, or it doesn\\'t fit into the way they have things mapped out\". Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for Vol. 3 to be his last Guardians film, which he reaffirmed in May 2021. In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after Vol. 3. In April 2023, Saldaña confirmed that Vol. 3 would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue. The following month, Pratt indicated his willingness to continue playing Peter Quill in the future if the right script came along, and a note at the end of Vol. 3\\'s post-credits scene states that the \"Legendary Star-Lord\" would return to the MCU.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website  at Marvel.com\\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 at IMDb', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')"
