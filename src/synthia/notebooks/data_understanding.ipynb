       "{'Article 39 - Exempt Officers and Sergeants Modified Duty Program.pdf': 'Office of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\nBACKGROUND\\n1. The City and San Jose Police Officers’ Association (SJPOA) recognize that, despite best\\nefforts to promote safety, police officers and sergeants are injured in the line of duty. Such\\ninjuries are unfortunate but can be a consequence of police work. The Exempt Officers’\\nand Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program (“Program”) is available to any police officer or\\nsergeant that has work-related or non-work related injuries or illnesses which preclude\\nhim or her from performing the full scope of his or her duties without accommodation.\\n2. The City and SJPOA recognize that police officers and sergeants exist to enforce the law\\nand protect public safety. Some essential job duties of a police officer and sergeant\\ninclude, but are not limited to, engaging in physically strenuous tasks, such as making\\nforcible arrests, pursuing fleeing suspects, responding to mass celebrations and\\ndemonstrations, and responding to emergency situations.\\n3. The City and SJPOA recognize that officers and sergeants with physical restrictions can\\nrepresent a valuable resource to the Police Department. Given the training and\\nexperience obtained by and invested in police officers and sergeants, the Police\\nDepartment can benefit from the knowledge and experience of officers and sergeants\\nwith physical restrictions.\\n4. The Program is intended to provide temporary modified duty assignments for officers or\\nsergeants with temporary work restrictions until the officer or sergeant is returned to full-\\nduty status or meets the maximum duration of participation in the Program as outlined\\nbelow.\\n5. The City and SJPOA recognize the legitimate interest of the San Jose Police Department\\nin maximizing the number of officers and sergeants available for Patrol duties, and other\\nphysically strenuous activities. The responsibilities of the Police Department are largely\\nphysical, involving suppression of criminal activity and exhibiting levels of force necessary\\nto control dangerous and unruly situations. Emergency situations also may require the\\nDepartment to provide a large uniformed presence. Additionally, at any particular time,\\nbecause of short-term disabilities, sick leave, military leave, training missions, family\\nleave, and the like, in addition to those in the Program, officers and sergeants are\\nunavailable for Patrol activities, reducing the actual level of officers and sergeants who\\nmay participate in Patrol assignments on a day-to-day basis. While the Department\\nrecognizes that non-physical assignments represent necessary and valuable aspects of\\npolice work, the philosophy of the Department is clearly Patrol-oriented. The first and\\nmain duty of the Department is the visible protection of the public. Because of these\\nprinciples, the parties recognize that the Department has a legitimate interest in limiting\\nthe number of officers and sergeants on the force who are physically unable to perform\\nthe strenuous physical activities necessary in a Patrol assignment. A goal of the Program\\nis to strike a balance between the business needs of the Department and the interests of\\ninjured officers and sergeants in meaningful employment in a temporary modified duty\\nassignment. Additionally, nothing in the Program requires the City of San Jose to change\\nits policies and procedures regarding the recruiting and hiring of police officers to entry-\\nlevel employment.\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 1 of 6\\nOffice of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\n6. The City and SJPOA recognize that the administration of the Police Department\\ncontinues to change over time, based on budget, staffing, criminal justice priorities,\\nnegotiated terms and conditions of employment, and numerous other factors. In view of\\nthe fluid nature of the organization, the parties intend to provide for flexibility in\\nadministering this Program, and recognize that changes in circumstances may require\\nchanges in the Program beyond the provisions contemplated herein. The Police\\nDepartment is committed to periodic review of positions within the Department, with a\\nview toward inclusion of positions in the Program. A goal of the Program is to provide for\\nflexibility in administering the Program to facilitate changed circumstances and maximum\\ninclusion of positions, given the interests of the Department and its officers and sergeants.\\n7. The City and SJPOA recognize an employer’s and its employees’ obligations under the\\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Employment and Housing Act.\\n8. The purpose of the Program is to provide a temporary modified duty Program for officers\\nand sergeants with temporary work restrictions.\\nSince this Program is to provide temporary modified duty, officers and sergeants with\\npermanent work restrictions are not eligible for the Program except as otherwise provided\\nherein. The City will engage in the interactive process with officers and sergeants with\\npermanent work restrictions.\\nPROCEDURES\\n1. Claims regarding the interpretation and application of the specific terms of this Program\\nshall be grievable under the Memorandum of Agreement between the City and the San\\nJose Police Officers’ Association, with the exception of any claim that the provisions of\\nthe Program violate state or federal law.\\n2. Nothing in the Program affects the provisions as negotiated in the Officers’ Transfer\\nPolicy or the Sergeants’ Transfer Policy with respect to officers and sergeants not\\ncovered by this Program. The transfer policies, as they pertain to the movement of\\nofficers and sergeants into and from specialized positions, shall apply to all officers and\\nsergeants other than those exempted therefrom under the Program.\\n3. Under the Program, a maximum number of officers and sergeants who, because of\\ninjury, are temporarily restricted by a physician from performing Patrol functions, shall\\nbe exempted from the requirement in the Officer and Sergeants’ Transfer Policies of\\nrotating into a Patrol assignment before and after holding a specialized assignment.\\nFor purposes of the Program, such officers and sergeants shall be referred to as\\n“exempt officers or sergeants,” or “officers or sergeants subject to the Program.”\\n4. When an officer or sergeant is first injured and temporarily restricted from performing\\nthe essential job duties of his or her position, including but not limited to the functions\\nof an arrest, but is otherwise released to return to work, the Department shall attempt\\nto accommodate that officer or sergeant within the officer’s or sergeant’s bureau of origin\\nfor up to 120 calendar days. Should an officer’s or sergeant’s restriction from performing\\nthe essential job duties of their position, including but not limited to the functions of an\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 2 of 6\\nOffice of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\narrest, or otherwise participating in Patrol activities continue in excess of 120 calendar\\ndays, that officer or sergeant shall then be assigned to one of the available vacant\\npositions in the Program.\\n5. The number of exempt officers and sergeants shall be determined by an analysis of the\\nDepartment’s ability to function effectively considering the inability of such officers and\\nsergeants to be assigned to a Patrol position. However, the maximum number of exempt\\npositions in the Program shall be twenty (20) positions. Of these twenty (20) positions\\nup to five (5) positions shall be designated for sergeants who participate in the Program.\\nSuch factors as total number of officers and sergeants, budgetary considerations, law\\nenforcement priorities, past experience, and other relevant criteria, shall be considered.\\nShould the Chief of Police determine that the maximum number of exempt officers or\\nsergeants should be changed, the requirements of City Charter Section 1111 (meet and\\nconfer with interest arbitration, if necessary) shall apply. Nothing in the Program prevents\\nan interim determination, should drastic changes in staffing resulting from budgetary\\ncuts, or other economic situations, occur.\\n6. The Department shall maintain a list of designated positions as determined by the Chief\\nof Police within the Department up to the maximum number of exempt positions within\\nthe Program. The list of designated exempt positions shall be organized based on the\\noperational need of the Department, as designated by the Chief of Police. All such\\npositions shall be administrative in nature and characterized by the fact that they do not\\nrequire an officer or sergeant to be able to perform the essential job duties of his or her\\nposition, including but not limited to the functions of an arrest.\\n7. Exempt positions shall be filled in order of priority, based on the operational needs of the\\nDepartment, as designated by the Chief of Police. Once in the Program, Exempt Officers\\nand Sergeants shall be assigned based on this priority designation. Once assigned to a\\nposition, the Exempt Officer or Sergeant shall remain in that assignment until such time\\nas:\\na. he or she is released to full duty;\\nb. his or her work restrictions change such that they can perform the essential\\nfunctions of a patrol assignment;\\nc. his or her work restrictions change such that the Department can no longer\\naccommodate them;\\nd. the Department’s operational needs change; or\\ne. the officer or sergeant exceeds the maximum duration in the Program as\\noutlined in Section 12 below.\\n8. The Program is intended to apply only to officers and sergeants who are temporarily\\nrestricted from performing the essential job duties of his or her position by a physician,\\nincluding the forcible arrest function. An officer or sergeant subject to the Program who\\nrecovers to the extent that he or she is no longer medically restricted from performing\\nthe essential job duties of their position, including the arrest function, and is cleared for\\nfull-duty Patrol activities, shall be reassigned to a Patrol or other full-duty position.\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 3 of 6\\nOffice of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\n9. The number of positions subject to the Exempt Officers’ and Sergeant’s Modified Duty\\nProgram shall not exceed the maximum number described in paragraph 5 above.\\nShould the number of exempt officers or sergeants equal that maximum number and\\nshould an additional officer or sergeant sustain injuries that would otherwise qualify for\\ninclusion in the Program, the following procedure shall apply: When it appears likely that\\nan officer or sergeant will qualify for the Program, the Department shall evaluate all the\\nofficers or sergeants subject to the Program to determine if there is a likelihood that,\\nthrough retirement or recovery, a vacancy within the Program will exist. If there is no\\nlikelihood of a vacancy, the Department shall make an announcement requesting a\\nvolunteer to vacate his or her position within the Program. In case of multiple volunteers,\\nthe officer or sergeant with the highest City seniority, i.e. highest amount of total time\\naccrued in all classes in the Classified Service, prevails. Should an officer or sergeant\\nvolunteer to vacate his or her position within the Program, that officer or sergeant may\\nexhaust his or her remaining accumulated sick time, vacation time, or compensatory\\ntime (integration time) pending an application for retirement. Should that volunteer\\nofficer or sergeant exhaust all integration time and not retire or separate from City\\nservice, the Department shall notify said officer or sergeant to either return to full-duty\\nstatus or be separated from City service. Should the volunteer apply for a disability\\nretirement, the Department shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does\\nnot have a position available for this volunteer because of the volunteer’s physical\\nrestrictions and lack of available Program positions. The Department shall assign the\\nofficer or sergeant becoming subject to the Program to one of the vacant positions.\\nShould no officers or sergeants volunteer to vacate his or her position, the injured officer\\nor sergeant shall be required to use any available leaves, including accumulated sick,\\nvacation, or compensatory time (integration time). Once that officer or sergeant’s\\navailable integration time has been used, and if no positions within the Program are then\\navailable, the officer or sergeant may exhaust any other leave entitlements. Once all\\npaid leave entitlements have been exhausted, the officer or sergeant may be granted\\nan unpaid leave of absence as a form of reasonable accommodation, pursuant to the\\nMemorandum of Agreement between the City and the San Jose Police Officers’\\nAssociation, while waiting for assignment to a vacant position in the Program. If after\\nexhaustion of all paid and unpaid leave there is no vacant position in the Program the\\nofficer or sergeant shall be notified by the Department to immediately return to full-duty\\nor may be separated from City service. Should the officer or sergeant apply for disability\\nretirement, the Department shall advise the Retirement Board that the Department does\\nnot have a position available for this officer or sergeant because of the officer’s or\\nsergeant’s physical restrictions and lack of available Program positions.\\n10. Should there be multiple officers or sergeants injured and a vacancy becomes available\\nin the Program, officers or sergeants shall be accepted into the Program in order of\\ndate of eligibility for entry into the Program, with the earliest date of entry into the\\nProgram being assigned first. If the entry dates are the same, then City seniority will\\ndetermine which officer or sergeant will enter the Program first.\\n11. If after assignment to a position in the Program, an officer or sergeant has a need for\\nany type of a leave of absence greater than six (6) weeks, the officer or sergeant will\\nbe considered to have voluntarily vacated the position in the Program. If the officer or\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 4 of 6\\nOffice of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\nsergeant is able to return to work in a temporary modified duty capacity after the leave\\nof absence, the officer or sergeant will be placed in a position for the remaining duration\\navailable for their injury, as outlined in paragraph 12 below, provided there is a vacant\\nposition in the Program available at that time.\\n12. Duration of Program for Exempt Officer or Sergeant. Officers or sergeants subject to\\nthe Exempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program shall be limited to\\nparticipation in a Program position for a maximum of two (2) calendar years, or\\nearlier if the employee’s work restrictions have been deemed permanent and stationary.\\nApproximately ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the two-year calendar term in\\nthe Program, the Department will notify the officer of the upcoming expiration and will\\ndiscuss options as set forth in paragraph 13 below.\\n13. Program. Once an officer or sergeant has participated in the Exempt Officers’ and\\nSergeants’ Modified Duty Program position for two (2) calendar years, or earlier if the\\nemployee’s work restrictions have been deemed permanent and stationary, the\\nDepartment will consider and discuss with the exempt officer or sergeant the following\\noptions:\\na. returning the member to full-duty with or without reasonable accommodation;\\nb. engaging the member in the interactive process;\\nc. using available paid leave, FMLA/CFRA leave, or absence through the\\nworkers’ compensation system, if applicable;\\nd. recommending disability retirement;\\ne. providing an unpaid leave of absence under the City’s Memorandum of\\nAgreement with the SJPOA;\\nf. employees with permanent and stationary restrictions who cannot be provided\\na reasonable accommodation are required to submit for a disability retirement\\nwithin 30 days of the conclusion of the interactive process;\\ng. initiating voluntary separation if none of the foregoing options are appropriate.\\nIf an employee in the program has applied for a disability retirement within 30 days from\\nthe effective date of the implementation of this Program and the disability retirement is\\npending determination by the Police and Fire Retirement Board, the maximum time in\\nthe program, under section 12, above, shall be extended until the Police and Fire\\nRetirement Board makes a determination of the employee’s disability retirement\\napplication. This extension shall not apply to any appeals of the Police and Fire\\nRetirement Board’s determination.\\n14. Promotion. The Department promotes officers to the rank of sergeant and sergeants to\\nthe rank of lieutenant, in compliance with civil service rules, from an eligibility list\\ncreated through a competitive examination. Officers and sergeants subject to the\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program shall not be prohibited from\\ncompeting for spots on the eligibility list for sergeant or lieutenant. Should an officer or\\nsergeant subject to the Program be selected to promote to sergeant or lieutenant, the\\nDepartment shall give consideration to assignments outside of the Patrol Division,\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 5 of 6\\nOffice of Employee Relations\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program\\nnotwithstanding the provision in the Sergeants’ Transfer Policy requiring incoming\\nsergeants to be assigned to a Field position.\\n15. Uniforms. Because the public regards an officer in uniform as being able to perform the\\nessential job duties of their positions, including but not limited to the forcible arrest\\nfunction and/or physical intervention function, Exempt Officers and Sergeants shall not\\nwear the police uniform while on duty. The Chief of Police may create exceptions under\\nappropriate circumstances.\\n16. Overtime. Each Unit has its own overtime policies. Approval or denial of overtime shall\\nbe determined based on the Department’s needs and consistent with the exempt\\nofficer’s or sergeant’s work restrictions.\\n17. Outside work permits. Exempt officers and sergeants shall be allowed to obtain outside\\nwork permits consistent with the nature and restrictions of his or her injuries.\\nApplications for work permits for exempt officers and sergeants shall be determined\\nbased on an officer’s or sergeant’s ability to physically perform the outside work, not on\\ninjured status alone.\\n18. Distribution of Policy. The City of San Jose must affirmatively offer copies of the\\nExempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program, as described above, to all\\npolice officers and sergeants.\\n19. Training. The City of San Jose must include training about this Program in its\\ncontinuing professional training.\\n20. CPT. Participation in the Exempt Officers’ and Sergeants’ Modified Duty Program shall not\\npreclude officers and sergeants from meeting their 24 hours of POST training\\nrequirements.\\nOriginal Effective Date: June 21, 2005\\nRevised Effective Date: May 11, 2020\\nPage 6 of 6',\n",

In the event of a holiday closure and with approval of the Department\\nDirector or designee, employees may take time off during the closure period, but\\ntaking time off shall not be a requirement.\\n16.7.1 Employees electing to take time off during a holiday closure may choose to\\ntake vacation, compensatory time, personal leave or lost time during the\\nclosure period. Employees who take lost time during the closure shall\\ncontinue to receive the following accruals: vacation, sick leave, citywide\\nseniority and department seniority.

If, in the judgment of the City Manager or designee, it is desirable by\\nreason of a shortage of staffing or increased volume of work, to permit any full-time\\nemployee to work for the City during the time ordinarily allocated to such employee\\nfor vacation purposes, the City Manager or designee may authorize such work. An\\nemployee who elects to perform such additional work shall be entitled to receive as\\nadditional compensation for such work an amount of money equal to their regular pay\\nfor such hours of work if such were not rendered during vacation leave, or, in lieu\\nthereof, the employee may file an election in writing with the Office of Employee\\nRelations to carry over such leave to the subsequent cycle of 26 biweekly pay periods.\\n17.6 Vacation Leave.

For purposes of\\nthis section, seniority shall be determined first by length of time\\nserved in the department, and, then, by time served in the City.\\n17.7 Computation of Vacation Leave\\n17.7.1 For purposes of this Article, paid leave of absence from duty by reason of\\nsick leave, holiday leave, vacation leave, , compensatory time-off, or any\\nother paid leave, shall be deemed to be \"time worked.\"\\n17.7.2 Prior periods of employment shall be credited to the employee for purposes\\nof determining vacation eligibility provided that during each such prior\\nemployment period, the employee achieved permanent status. An\\nemployee in an initial probationary status shall not be permitted to take a\\nvacation during the first 13 pay periods of employment even though such\\nemployee may, upon satisfactory completion of the initial probationary\\nperiod be entitled to additional vacation pursuant to the above.\\n17.8 Personal Leave.

In addition, accrued sick leave\\nmay be utilized by an eligible female employee due to illness, injury, or\\ndisability related to pregnancy or child-birth.\\n18.1.3 Up to forty-eight (48) hours of accrued sick leave per calendar year may be\\nutilized if the employee is required to be absent for the care related to the\\nillness or injury of the employee’s grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister,\\nfather-in-law, mother-in-law, step-father, step-mother, or step-child.\\nThe provisions of this section related to the use of sick leave for the care\\nrelated to the illness or injury of the employee’s family members as\\ndefined above shall expire at the end of the term of this Agreement. In the\\nnegotiations for a successor Agreement, the parties shall review and\\nevaluate the appropriateness of this benefit.\\n18.1.4 Except as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council, paid sick\\nleave shall not be allowed for any absence from work occasioned by\\nintoxication, chronic alcoholism or use of narcotics not prescribed by a\\nlicensed physician.\\n18.1.5 No employee shall be entitled to or be granted sick leave, either with or\\nwithout pay, unless he, or someone on his or her behalf, notifies the\\nemployee’s immediate superior, Department Director, Director of Human\\nResources or designee, of the employee’s intent to take such sick leave,\\nand of the reasons therefore, prior to or within one (1) hour after the\\ncommencement of the sick leave provided, however, that the City Manager\\nor designee may waive the requirement of such notice upon presentation of\\na reasonable excuse of such employee.\\n18.1.6 Any time an employee is required to report to work and is unable to report\\ndue to illness or injury, an employee may be required to furnish medical\\nverification or other substantiation for any such absence.\\n18.1.7 A full-time employee of the City shall be entitled to sick leave without any\\npay if required to be absent from work on account of any non-job related\\nillness, injury or disability, including absences of female employees related\\nto pregnancy or childbirth, in all situations where such employee is not\\nentitled to sick leave with pay. No single period of sick leave without pay\\nshall exceed twelve (12) consecutive months, or eighteen (18) cumulative\\nmonths in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months. Any\\nemployee who is unable to return to work at the expiration of either of\\nthese periods of time shall be separated from City service.\\n18.2 For employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, a sick leave payout shall be\\ngiven to each full-time employee at the time of retirement or death under one of the\\nABMEI MOA July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 Page 32\\nfollowing conditions:\\n18.2.1 Federated Retirement Plan:\\nThe employee is:\\n18.2.1.1 A member of the Federated Retirement Plan, and\\n18.2.1.2 Retired under the provisions cited in the plan, and\\n18.2.1.3 Credited with at least fifteen (15) years of service in this\\nretirement plan, or\\n18.2.1.4 Credited with at least ten (10) years of service prior to a\\ndisability retirement.\\n18.2.2 Terminated Employee with Vesting Rights\\nThe employee has:\\n18.2.2.1 Terminated service with the City,\\n18.2.2.2 Retained vesting rights in a retirement system according to\\nprovisions in the San Jose Municipal Code, and\\n18.2.2.3 Following such termination, qualifies for retirement and retires\\nunder the provisions cited in the code, and\\n18.2.2.4 Has at the time of retirement credit for at least fifteen (15) years\\nof service in the applicable retirement plan.\\n18.2.3 Death During Service\\nThe estate of any full-time employee who dies while in City service and\\nprior to retirement, even though the employee is not credited with at least\\nfifteen (15) years of service in any applicable retirement plan.\\n18.2.4 Death of Terminated Employee\\nThe estate of any full-time employee who:\\n18.2.4.1 Had terminated service with the City but had retained vesting\\nrights in a retirement system according to provisions in the San\\nJose Municipal Code, and\\n18.2.4.2 Dies prior to becoming eligible for retirement allowances as\\nABMEI MOA July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 Page 33\\ncited under provisions of the San Jose Municipal Code, and\\n18.2.4.3 Has at the time of death credit for at least fifteen (15) years of\\nservice in the applicable retirement plan.\\n18.3 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of calculating a sick leave payout, employees’\\nsick leave balances and hourly rates shall be frozen. This means that an employee will\\nreceive no more for a sick leave payout, after having met the requirements set forth\\nabove, than he or she would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave\\nusage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after\\nJune 22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June 22, 2013,\\nbut it may not be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and his or her sick leave balance is\\n1000 hours on June 22, 2013, then if he or she meets the eligibility requirements\\ncontained herein, the payout of a sick leave balance at the time of retirement will be\\nbased on the formula below, and shall be based on no more than 1000 hours and an\\nhourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has\\nsubsequently earned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase to\\nan hourly rate higher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not have\\navailable sick leave to use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave\\nand reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013, to 800 hours, they will only be\\nentitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued after\\nJune 22, 2013. This means that if sick leave payout hours are reduced by usage, they\\nare not able to be reestablished in the sick leave balance subject to payout.\\n18.4 Payout shall be determined as follows:\\n18.4.1 If an eligible full-time employee, as defined in subsection 18.2 above, at\\nthe time of their retirement or death, has earned unused sick leave hours,\\nthe employee or Estate shall be paid the equivalent of a specified percent of\\ntheir hourly rate of pay as of June 22, 2013, multiplied by the total number\\nof the employee’s accumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of June\\n22, 2013 (minus any sick leave hours as of June 22, 2013, which were\\nused) in accordance with 18.4.1.1.\\n18.4.1.1 Less than 400 hours: Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n50% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013\\n400 – 799 hours: Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n60% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013\\n800 – 1200 hours: Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n75% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013\\nABMEI MOA July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 Page 34\\n18.5 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for any Sick\\nLeave Payout.\\n18.6 Employees are only eligible for one (1) sick leave payout while employed by the City\\nof San Jose, including breaks in employment.\\n18.7 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours:\\nFor purposes of determining the total number of accumulated and unused hours of\\nsick leave of a full-time employee before June 22, 2013, unused sick leave from prior\\nperiods of employment with the City shall be used. Previously accumulated sick leave\\nshall be credited to the employee for use during an employee\\'s current employment\\nperiod.\\nARTICLE 19 DISABILITY LEAVE\\n19.1 Disability Leave. Effective June 24, 2012, employees are no longer eligible to receive\\nDLS.\\n19.2 Integration. The integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the\\nfollowing order: (1) accrued Vacation hours, (2) earned Compensatory Time once\\nVacation has been exhausted, and (3) accrued Sick Leave once Vacation and\\nCompensatory Time have both been exhausted.\\n19.2.1 In no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any Workers’\\nCompensation Temporary Disability payments, in excess of the\\nemployee’s regular base salary\\nARTICLE 20 MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP\\n20.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, each employee who, on July 1, 2018, is a\\nmember in good standing of the Organization shall thereafter, as a condition of\\nemployment, maintain such membership for the duration of this Agreement, to the\\nextent of paying the periodic dues uniformly required by the Organization as a\\ncondition of retaining membership.\\n20.2 Any employee who, on July 1, 2018, is not a member of the Organization nor any\\nperson who becomes an employee after July 1, 2018, shall not be required to become\\na member as a condition of employment.

The transition began on June 28, 2009. The Plan’s\\ninitial unfunded retiree healthcare liability shall be fully amortized over a thirty year\\nperiod so that it shall be paid by June 30, 2039 (closed amortization). Amortization of\\nchanges in the unfunded retiree healthcare liability other than the initial retiree\\nhealthcare liability (e.g. gains, losses, changes in actuarial assumptions, etc.) shall be\\ndetermined by the Plan’s actuary. The City and Plan members (active employees)\\nshall contribute to funding the ARC in the ratio currently provided under Section\\n3.28.385 of the San Jose Municipal Code. Specifically, contributions for retiree\\nmedical benefits shall be made by the City and members in the ratio of one-to-one.\\nContributions for retiree dental benefits shall be made by the City and members in the\\nratio of eight-to-three. When determining the contribution rates for the Plan, the Plan\\nactuary shall continue to use the Entry Age Normal (EAN) actuarial cost method and\\na discount rate consistent with the pre-funding policy for the Plan as outlined in this\\nABMEI MOA July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 Page 37\\nArticle.\\n25.2 The City and the Employee Organization further agree that the Municipal Code\\nand/or applicable plan documents shall be amended to the extent necessary in\\naccordance with this agreement and that the Employee Organization will support such\\namendments.\\n25.3 It is understood that in reaching this agreement, the parties have been informed by\\ncost estimates prepared by the Federated City Employees’ Retirement System Board’s\\nactuary and that the actual contribution rates to reach full pre-funding of retiree\\nhealthcare will differ. The phase-in to the ARC shall be effective on the first pay\\nperiod of the City’s fiscal year in each succeeding year, the first increment which was\\neffective on June 28, 2009. It is understood that because of changes resulting from\\nfuture actuarial valuations, the amount of the ARC may vary upward or downward.\\nThe City and Employee Organization agree that the retiree healthcare contribution\\nrates as of June 20, 2015, shall remain in effect until December 19, 2015.

In subsequent\\nfiscal years, the City and the plan members shall be contributing the full Annual\\nRequired Contribution in the ratio currently provided under Section 3.28.385 of the\\nSan Jose Municipal Code.\\n25.4 The City has established a qualified 115 trust (\"Trust\"). Employee contributions will\\nbegin going into the Trust in time to avoid any potential of reaching IRS limits on the\\nexisting medical benefits account or upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS that the\\ncontributions can be treated as pre-tax, whichever occurs first.\\n25.5 If employee contributions are deposited into the Trust prior to receiving a ruling from\\nthe IRS that the contributions can be treated as pre-tax and the City subsequently\\nreceived an IRS determination that the contributions should be treated as post-tax, the\\nCity agrees to indemnify any employee as to any IRS liability arising solely from the\\ncontributions that were taken as pre-tax prior to the IRS determination. The City and\\nthe Employee Organization will immediately meet and confer over an alternative trust\\nvehicle for the prospective contributions should the IRS determine that the\\ncontributions are post-tax.\\n25.6 It is the objective of the parties that the Trust created pursuant to this agreement shall\\nbecome the sole funding vehicle for Federated retiree healthcare benefits, subject to\\nany legal restrictions under the current plan, or other applicable law.\\n25.7 Employees hired into full-time benefited positions on or after the first payperiod\\nfollowing the effective date of the ordinance implementing this provision (“Effective\\nDate”) will not participate in or be eligible for the defined benefit retiree healthcare\\nprogram. The City will pay the unfunded liability contribution that these employees\\nand the City would have otherwise paid had they gone into the retiree healthcare\\ndefined benefit program.\\nABMEI MOA July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 Page 38\\n25.8 Neither the City nor the Employee Organization waives any rights or assertions, each\\nmay have, related to the retiree healthcare benefit through any of the provisions of\\nthis Article.\\nARTICLE 26 PROBATIONARY PERIODS\\n26.1 Probationary periods shall not be less than six (6) or twelve (12) months of actual\\nservice as determined by the Civil Service Commission.

Failure to attend or to provide proof of such\\nattendance may subject the employee to disciplinary action. Actual results of the\\ninitial screening shall be subject to normal confidentiality provisions, unless the\\nemployee voluntarily signs a release of information form.

This\\nmeans that an employee will receive no more in sick leave payout after\\nhaving met the requirements contained herein than they would have\\nbeen entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave usage after June 22,\\n2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after June\\n22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June\\n22, 2013, but it may not be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and their sick leave\\nbalance is 1000 hours on June 22, 2013, if they meet eligibility\\nrequirements, they shall receive a payout of their sick leave balance at\\nthe time of retirement using the formula below, but no more than 1000\\nhours and at an hourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even\\nif the employee has subsequently earned more than 1000 hours in sick\\nleave or received a pay increase so that their hourly rate is higher than\\n$40. In this example, if the employee does not have available sick\\nleave to use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave\\nand reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013 to 800 hours,\\nthey will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours,\\nregardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This means\\nthat if sick leave payout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able\\nto be reestablished in the sick leave balance subject to payout.\\nPayout shall be determined as follows:\\n8.4.1.5.1 If an eligible full-time employee, as defined in subsection\\n8.4.1 above, at the time of their retirement or death has\\nearned, unused sick leave hours, the employee shall be paid\\nthe equivalent of a specified percent of their hourly rate of\\npay at the time of retirement, termination or death,\\nwhichever comes first, multiplied by the total number of\\nthe employee’s accumulated and unused hours of sick leave\\nas of the date of the employee’s retirement or death.\\n• Less than 400 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n50% of final hourly rate\\n• 400 - 799 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n60% of final hourly rate\\n• 800 - 1200 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n75% of final hourly rate\\n8.4.1.6 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours: For purposes of\\ndetermining the total number of accumulated and unused hours of sick\\nleave of a full-time employee at the time of the employee’s retirement\\nAEA (Unit 43) MOA July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2023 Page 17\\nor death, unused sick leave from prior periods of employment before\\nJune 22, 2013, with the City shall be used.

Forty (40) additional hours may be available,\\nupon Departmental Director approval, for recognition of outstanding performance as part\\nof the Management Performance Program.

However, an employee who has reached this limit may apply for a leave\\nof absence without pay pursuant to Section 8.11, Leave of Absence.\\n8.3.10 Any such part-time employee shall be entitled to paid sick leave only for those\\ndays and number of hours the employee is in fact regularly assigned to work or\\nwould have been required to work, notwithstanding the designation, scheduling\\nand indefinite assignment made pursuant to this Article.\\n8.3.11 No eligible part-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with pay for any day\\nor portion of a day during which the employee is absent, if in fact the employee is\\nnot regularly assigned to work or would not have been required to work on that\\nday, inclusive of any hours an employee elects to work in addition to their\\nindefinite assignment, notwithstanding the designation, scheduling and indefinite\\nassignment made pursuant to this Article.\\n8.4 Sick Leave Payout\\n8.4.1 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for sick\\nleave payout.\\nFor employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, sick leave payout shall be\\ngiven to each full-time employee at the time of retirement or death under one of\\nthe following conditions:\\n8.4.1.1 Federated Retirement Plan:\\n8.4.1.1.1 The employee is:\\n• A member of the Federated Retirement Plan, and\\n• Retired under the provisions cited in the plan, and\\n• Credited with at least fifteen (15) years of service in\\nthis retirement plan, or\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 15\\n• Credited with at least ten (10) years of service prior to a\\ndisability retirement.\\n8.4.1.2 Terminated Employee with Vesting Rights\\n8.4.1.2.1 The employee has:\\n• Terminated service with the City, and\\n• Retained vesting rights in a retirement system\\naccording to provisions in the SJMC, and\\n• Following such termination, qualifies for retirement and\\nretires under the provisions cited in the code and\\n• Has at the time of retirement credit for at least fifteen\\n(15) years of service in the applicable retirement plan.\\n8.4.1.3 Death During Service The estate of any full-time employee who dies\\nwhile in City service and prior to retirement, even though the\\nemployee is not credited with at least fifteen (15) years of service in\\nany applicable retirement plan.\\n8.4.1.4 Death of Terminated Employee\\n8.4.1.4.1 The estate of any full-time employee who:\\n• Had terminated service with the City but had retained\\nvesting rights in a retirement system according to\\nprovisions in the SJMC, and\\n• Dies prior to becoming eligible for retirement\\nallowances as cited under provisions of the SJMC, and\\n• Has at the time of death credit for at least fifteen (15)\\nyears of service in the applicable retirement plan.\\n8.4.1.5 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of sick leave payout, an\\nemployee’s sick leave balance and hourly rate shall be frozen. This\\nmeans that an employee will receive no more in sick leave payout after\\nhaving met the requirements contained herein than they would have\\nbeen entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave usage after June 22,\\n2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after June\\n22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June\\n22, 2013, but it may not be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and their sick leave\\nbalance is 1000 hours on June 22, 2013, if they meet eligibility\\nrequirements, they shall receive a payout of their sick leave balance at\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 16\\nthe time of retirement using the formula below, but no more than 1000\\nhours and at an hourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even\\nif the employee has subsequently earned more than 1000 hours in sick\\nleave or received a pay increase so that their hourly rate is higher than\\n$40. In this example, if the employee does not have available sick\\nleave to use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave\\nand reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013 to 800 hours,\\nthey will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours,\\nregardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This means\\nthat if sick leave payout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able\\nto be reestablished in the sick leave balance subject to payout.\\nPayout shall be determined as follows:\\n8.4.1.5.1 If an eligible full-time employee, as defined in subsection\\n8.4.1 above, at the time of their retirement or death has\\nearned, unused sick leave hours, the employee shall be paid\\nthe equivalent of a specified percent of their hourly rate of\\npay at the time of retirement, termination or death,\\nwhichever comes first, multiplied by the total number of\\nthe employee’s accumulated and unused hours of sick leave\\nas of the date of the employee’s retirement or death.\\n• Less than 400 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n50% of final hourly rate\\n• 400 - 799 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n60% of final hourly rate\\n• 800 - 1200 hours: Hours accumulated x\\n75% of final hourly rate\\n8.4.1.6 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours: For purposes of\\ndetermining the total number of accumulated and unused hours of sick\\nleave of a full-time employee at the time of the employee’s retirement\\nor death, unused sick leave from prior periods of employment before\\nJune 22, 2013, with the City shall be used. Previously accumulated\\nsick leave shall be credited to the employee for use during an\\nemployee\\'s current employment period.\\n8.5 Executive Leave Employees will receive forty (40) hours of executive leave per payroll\\ncalendar year with supervisor approval. Forty (40) additional hours may be available,\\nupon Departmental Director approval, for recognition of outstanding performance as part\\nof the Management Performance Program. Executive leave that is not used by the end of\\nthe payroll calendar year does not accrue or carry over to the following year.\\n8.5.1 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, when an employee is\\nhired or promoted into a position eligible for executive leave, the leave will be\\nprorated during the first year dependent upon the hire date.\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 17\\nStart Date in Position Hours of Executive Leave\\nJanuary 1 – February 28 40 hours\\n(February 29 on a Leap Year)\\nMarch 1 – April 30 32 hours\\nMay 1 – June 30 24 hours\\nJuly 1 – August 31 16 hours\\nSeptember 1 – October 31 8 hours\\nNovember 1 – End of Payroll 0 hours\\nCalendar Year\\n8.5.1.1 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an\\nemployee who is promoted or demoted into an AEA-represented\\nclassification will have the number of Executive Leave hours they\\nreceive upon promotion or demotion reduced on an hour-for-hour\\nbasis based on their usage of Personal Leave and/or Executive Leave\\nwithin the same payroll calendar year.\\n8.5.2 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an employee on a\\nreduced work week schedule will receive executive leave as indicated in the chart\\nbelow, even if the actual hours worked exceed that amount.\\nScheduled Work Hours Benefit Level Hours of\\nper Week Executive Leave\\n35-39.9 hours per week 100% 40 hours\\n30-34.9 hours per week 75% 30 hours\\n25-29.9 hours per week 62.5% 25 hours\\n20-24.9 hours per week 50% 20 hours\\nLess than 20 hours per week Unbenefited None\\n8.5.3 Further details related to Executive Leave, including details related to the use of\\nthe four-hour rule, are contained in City Policy Manual Section 4.2.4, Executive\\nLeave and Absence Policy.\\n8.6 Disability Leave\\n8.6.1 Termination of Leave An employee who is unable to return to full time regular\\nduty following the expiration of the integration of accrued vacation and of Sick\\nLeave as provided in Section 8.3 and with Workers\\' Compensation may be\\nseparated from City service.\\n8.6.2 Integration Integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the\\nfollowing order: (1) accrued Vacation hours, and (2) accrued Sick Leave once\\nVacation has been exhausted.\\n• In no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any Workers’\\nCompensation Temporary Disability payments, in excess of the employee’s\\nregular base salary.\\n8.7 Bereavement Leave Each full time or benefited part-time employee shall be granted\\nbereavement leave with full pay for up to forty (40) work hours to attend to the\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 18\\ncustomary obligations arising from the death of any of the following relatives of such\\nemployee or employee’s spouse or employee’s domestic partner.

The transition began on June 28, 2009. The Plan’s\\ninitial unfunded retiree healthcare liability shall be fully amortized over a thirty year\\nperiod so that it shall be paid by June 30, 2039 (closed amortization). Amortization of\\nchanges in the unfunded retiree healthcare liability other than the initial retiree healthcare\\nliability (e.g. gains, losses, changes in actuarial assumptions, etc.) shall be determined by\\nthe Plan’s actuary. The City and Plan members (active employees) shall contribute to\\nfunding the ARC in the ratio currently provided under Section 3.28.385 of the San Jose\\nMunicipal Code. Specifically, contributions for retiree medical benefits shall be made by\\nthe City and members in the ratio of one-to-one. Contributions for retiree dental benefits\\nshall be made by the City and members in the ratio of eight-to-three. When determining\\nthe contribution rates for the Plan, the Plan actuary shall continue to use the Entry Age\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 30\\nNormal (EAN) actuarial cost method and a discount rate consistent with the pre-funding\\npolicy for the Plan as outlined in this Article.\\n12.2 The City and the Employee Organization further agree that the Municipal Code and/or\\napplicable plan documents shall be amended to the extent necessary in accordance with\\nthis agreement and that the Employee Organization will support such amendments.\\n12.3 It is understood that in reaching this agreement, the parties have been informed by cost\\nestimates prepared by the Federated City Employees’ Retirement System Board’s actuary\\nand that the actual contribution rates to reach full pre-funding of retiree healthcare will\\ndiffer. The phase-in to the ARC shall be effective on the first pay period of the City’s\\nfiscal year in each succeeding year, the first increment which was on June 28, 2009. It is\\nunderstood that because of changes resulting from future actuarial valuations, the amount\\nof the ARC may vary upward or downward. The City and Employee Organization agree\\nthat the retiree healthcare contribution rates as of June 20, 2015, will remain in effect\\nuntil December 19, 2015. The City and plan members shall be contributing the\\ncontribution rate based upon the full Annual Required Contribution, beginning on\\nDecember 20, 2015.

Employee contributions will\\nbegin going into the Trust in time to avoid any potential of reaching the IRS limits on the\\nexisting medical benefits account or upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS that the\\ncontributions can be treated as pre-tax, whichever occurs first.\\n12.5 If employee contributions are deposited into the Trust prior to receiving a ruling from the\\nIRS that the contributions can be treated as pre-tax and the City subsequently receives an\\nIRS determination that the contributions should be treated as post-tax, the City agrees to\\nindemnify any employee as to any IRS liability arising solely from the contributions that\\nwere taken as pre-tax prior to the IRS determination. The City and the Employee\\nOrganization will immediately meet and confer over an alternative trust vehicle for the\\nprospective contributions should the IRS determine that the contributions are post-tax.\\n12.6 It is the objective of the parties that the Trust created pursuant to this agreement shall\\nbecome the sole funding vehicle for Federated retiree healthcare benefits, subject to any\\nlegal restrictions under the current plan, or other applicable law.\\n12.7 Employees hired into full-time benefited positions on or after the first payperiod\\nfollowing the effective date of the ordinance implementing this provision (“Effective\\nDate”) will not participate in or be eligible for the defined benefit retiree healthcare\\nprogram. The City will pay the unfunded liability contribution that these employees and\\nthe City would have otherwise paid had they gone into the retiree healthcare defined\\nbenefit program.\\n12.8 Neither the City nor the Employee Organization waives any rights or assertions, each\\nmay have, related to the retiree healthcare benefit through any of the provisions in this\\nArticle.\\nAEA (Units 41 & 42) MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 31\\nARTICLE 13 SAFETY\\n13.1 The City shall provide a safe and healthy working environment in accordance with\\napplicable Local, State and Federal laws and regulations.\\n13.2 Any employee who believes a violation exists may request that the City make a\\ndetermination as to the safeness of the work assignment and further, be protected under\\nthe Cal/OSHA regulations, including but not limited to Labor Code Section 6311.\\nARTICLE 14 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT\\n14.1 The City agrees to make available all required personal protective equipment when\\nneeded during the normal course of work (i.e., protective eyewear, protective footwear)\\nin compliance with Cal-OSHA regulations and upon approval of the Department Director\\nor designee.\\n14.2 The City agrees to provide a voucher for the purchase of protective footwear for up to\\n$200 for employees when it is determined by the Director of Human Resources or\\ndesignee that protective footwear is required for the employee.

This provision reflects the current status of the retiree\\nhealthcare benefit pending an interim and/or long term resolution of the issues.\\n15.2 Eligibility for the retiree healthcare benefit is determined in accordance with the San Jose\\nMunicipal Code.\\n15.3 On April 21, 2009, the City started implementing a plan to transition to full pre-funding of the\\nretiree healthcare benefit for unrepresented Executive Management employees (Unit 99). At\\nthe time, all of the member classifications currently in ALP were unrepresented and in Unit 99.\\nALP was formed as a bargaining unit after the City’s imposition of the full pre-funding plan.\\nThe full pre-funding plan that the City currently is implementing is set forth in Resolution No.\\n74882, entitled “A Resolution of the Council of the City of San Jose Approving Agreements\\nBetween the City of San Jose and Several Bargaining Units Regarding Retiree Healthcare\\nFunding, and Implementing Retiree Healthcare Funding for Units 99 and 82,” and the April 7,\\n2009, Memorandum to the Mayor and City Council attached as Attachment A thereto.\\n15.4 The City and employees represented by the Association began to transition from the current\\npartial pre-funding of retiree medical and dental healthcare benefits (referred to as the \"policy\\nmethod\") to pre-funding of the full Annual Required Contribution (ARC) for the retiree\\nhealthcare plan (\"Plan\"). The transition began on June 28, 2009. The Plan’s initial unfunded\\nretiree healthcare liability shall be fully amortized over a thirty year period so that it shall be\\npaid by June 30, 2039 (closed amortization). Amortization of changes in the unfunded retiree\\nhealthcare liability other than the initial retiree healthcare liability (e.g. gains, losses, changes in\\nactuarial assumptions, etc.) shall be determined by the Plan’s actuary. The City and Plan\\nmembers (active employees) shall contribute to funding the ARC in the ratio currently provided\\nunder Section 3.28.385 of the San Jose Municipal Code. Specifically, contributions for retiree\\nALP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 11\\nmedical benefits shall be made by the City and members in the ratio of one-to-one.\\nContributions for retiree dental benefits shall be made by the City and members in the ratio of\\neight-to-three. When determining the contribution rates for the Plan, the Plan actuary shall\\ncontinue to use the Entry Age Normal (EAN) actuarial cost method and a discount rate\\nconsistent with the pre-funding policy for the Plan as outlined in this section.\\n15.5 The City and the Association agree that the Municipal Code and/or applicable plan documents\\nshall be amended to the extent necessary in accordance with this agreement and that the\\nAssociation will support such amendments.\\n15.6 The phase-in to the ARC shall be effective on the first pay period of the City’s fiscal year in\\neach succeeding year, the first increment which was effective on June 28, 2009. It is\\nunderstood that because of changes resulting from future actuarial valuations, the amount of the\\nARC may vary upward or downward. The City and the Association agree that the retiree\\nhealthcare contribution rates as of June 20, 2015 will remain in effect until December 19, 2015.\\nNotwithstanding the limitations on the incremental increases, the City and plan members shall\\nbe contributing the contribution rate based upon the full Annual Required Contribution,\\nbeginning on December 20, 2015. In subsequent fiscal years, the City and the plan members\\nshall be contributing the full Annual Required Contribution in the ratio currently provided\\nunder Section 3.28.385 of the San Jose Municipal Code.\\n15.7 The City has established a qualified 115 trust (\"Trust\"). Employee contributions will begin\\ngoing into the Trust in time to avoid any potential of reaching IRS limits on the existing\\nmedical benefits account or upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS that the contributions can be\\ntreated as pre-tax, whichever occurs first.\\n15.8 If employee contributions are deposited into the Trust prior to receiving a ruling from the IRS\\nthat the contributions can be treated as pre-tax and the City subsequently receives an IRS\\ndetermination that the contributions should be treated as post-tax, the City agrees to indemnify\\nany employee as to any IRS liability arising solely from the contributions that were taken as\\npre-tax prior to the IRS determination. The City and the Association will immediately meet\\nand confer over an alternative trust vehicle for the prospective contributions should the IRS\\ndetermine that the contributions are post-tax.\\n15.9 It is the objective of the parties that the Trust created pursuant to this Agreement shall become\\nthe sole funding vehicle for Federated retiree healthcare benefits, subject to any legal\\nrestrictions, under the current plan, or other applicable law.\\n15.10 Employees hired into full-time benefited positions on or after September 29, 2013, (\"Effective\\nDate\") will not participate in or be eligible for the defined benefit retiree healthcare program.\\nThe City will pay the unfunded liability contribution that these employees and the City would\\nhave otherwise paid had they gone into the retiree healthcare defined benefit program. By\\nagreeing to this provision, neither the City nor the Association have committed to closing the\\nretiree healthcare plan.\\n15.11 Neither the City nor the Association waives any rights or assertions, each may have, related to\\nthe retiree healthcare benefit through any of the provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement\\nshall not be considered a waiver by the City, the Association or the employees represented by\\nALP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 12\\nthe Association, of any rights or assertions each may have regarding the retiree healthcare\\nbenefit, including but not limited to any rights or assertions related to any of the following:\\n• Any vested rights employees may or may not have related to the retiree healthcare benefit,\\n• The meaning of any San Jose Municipal Code provisions or provisions of other documents\\nrelated to the scope and/or implementation of the retiree healthcare benefit,\\n• The retiree healthcare benefit funding plan implemented by the City,\\n• The member contribution rates established by the Retirement Board and the deductions\\nmade by the City from employee payroll checks for the retiree healthcare benefit, or\\n• Any other issue related to the retiree healthcare benefit, including but not limited to any\\nissue under the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (“MMBA”) regarding matters within the scope\\nof representation.\\nNothing in this section is intended to expand either party’s rights, which each may have,\\nregarding retiree healthcare.\\n15.12 The parties acknowledge that, on June 12, 2012, the City unilaterally imposed the “Kaiser\\n1500” healthcare plan referred to in Article 17 of this Agreement for bargaining unit\\nemployees.\\nARTICLE 16 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN\\n16.1 The City will provide full-time Association employees with the option of participating in the\\nCity’s deferred compensation plan as set forth in Chapter 3.48 of Title 3 of the San Jose\\nMunicipal Code on the Effective Date.\\n16.2 Part-time Association employees participate in the City’s PTC plan as set forth in Chapter 3.50\\nof Title 3 of the San Jose Municipal Code on the Effective Date.\\nARTICLE 17 HEALTH INSURANCE\\n17.1 Plans: The City will provide health coverage for eligible employees and their dependents under\\none of the available plans for employee only or employee and dependents.

Employees may only accrue vacation up to a\\nmaximum of two (2) times their annual accrual rate. Once an employee\\nreaches their maximum accrued vacation limit, the employee will not accrue\\nvacation until their vacation balance falls below the maximum limit.\\nEmployees who currently have accrued vacation balances that are in excess of\\nthe limits below, will maintain their current balance, however they will not\\naccrue vacation until their balance falls below the maximum limit, or have\\nsold back an amount that brings them below their maximum accrual amount.\\nYears of Service Maximum Accrued Vacation\\n1 – 5 240 hours\\n6 – 14 320 hours\\n15+ 400 hours\\n8.2.2.1 Effective calendar year 2016, employees may sell back up to a\\nmaximum of forty (40) hours of accrued vacation per calendar\\nyear.\\n8.2.2.2 Beginning calendar year 2019, employees may sell back up to a\\nmaximum of sixty (60) hours of accrued vacation.\\n8.2.2.3 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations require the City to\\nreport and withhold taxes on the value of the vacation time an\\nemployee is eligible to sell back.

This means that hours elected\\nfor sell back may only be used for sell back purposes and cannot\\nbe used for vacation time off purposes.\\n8.2.2.8 Employees may use any vacation hours accrued and carried over\\nprior to the given year, subject to the normal rules of requesting\\nuse of vacation.\\n8.3 Sick Leave\\n8.3.1 Each full-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with pay in accordance\\nwith the following provisions:\\n8.3.1.1 Sick leave shall accrue in an amount equal to the number of hours\\nworked multiplied by a factor of 0.04616. Paid leave for holidays,\\nvacation, or other paid leave shall be considered as time worked\\nfor purposes of this section.\\n8.3.2 Accrued sick leave may be utilized if the employee is required to be absent\\nfrom work on account of non-job related illness or injury; routine medical or\\ndental appointments, or for the care related to the illness or injury of the\\nemployee’s child, mother, father, spouse or domestic partner registered with\\nthe Department of Human Resources. Up to 48 hours of accrued sick leave\\nper calendar year may be utilized if the employee is required to be absent for\\nthe care related to the illness or injury of the employee’s grandparent,\\ngrandchild, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, stepfather,\\nstepmother or stepchild.\\n8.3.3 Accrued sick leave not to exceed three (3) working days may be granted in\\ncircumstances where an alleged job-related illness or injury is involved, but\\nthe employee fails to provide medical verification of such job-related illness\\nor injury.\\n8.3.4 Accrued sick leave also may be used in accordance with the Catastrophic\\nIllness Time Donation Program.\\n8.3.5 Except as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council, paid sick\\nleave shall not be allowed for any absence from work occasioned by\\nintoxication, or use of narcotics not prescribed by a licensed physician.\\nAMSP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 15\\n8.3.6 If approved by the City, an employee who is enrolled and participating in a\\nsubstance abuse treatment program may use sick leave for absences resulting\\nfrom participation in such program. The City may require appropriate\\nverification.\\n8.3.7 No employee shall be entitled to or be granted sick leave, either with or\\nwithout pay, unless he or she, or someone on his or her behalf notifies his or\\nher immediate superior or Department Director, of his or her intent to take\\nsuch sick leave due to a personal or family illness prior to the commencement\\nof the sick leave where such notice is possible; provided, however, that the\\nDirector of Employee Relations may waive the requirement of such notice\\nupon presentation of a reasonable excuse by such employee.\\n8.3.8 An employee may be required to furnish substantiation for any absence for\\nwhich sick leave payment is requested.\\n8.3.9 A full-time employee of the City shall be entitled to sick leave without any\\npay if required to be absent from work on account of any non-job related\\nillness, injury or disability, in all situations where such employee is not\\nentitled to sick leave with pay. Any full-time employee who is unable to\\nreturn to work after being absent on paid and/or unpaid sick leave for a\\nmaximum of twelve (12) consecutive months or for a maximum of eighteen\\n(18) cumulative months in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months\\nmay be separated from City service. However, an employee who has reached\\nthis limit may apply for a leave of absence without pay pursuant to Section\\n8.9, Leaves of Absence.\\n8.3.10 Any such part-time employee shall be entitled to paid sick leave only for those\\ndays and number of hours the employee is in fact regularly assigned to work\\nor would have been required to work, notwithstanding the designation,\\nscheduling and indefinite assignment made pursuant to this Article.\\n8.3.11 No eligible part-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with pay for any\\nday or portion of a day during which the employee is absent, if in fact the\\nemployee is not regularly assigned to work or would not have been required to\\nwork on that day, inclusive of any hours an employee elects to work in\\naddition to their indefinite assignment, notwithstanding the designation,\\nscheduling and indefinite assignment made pursuant to this Article.\\n8.4 Sick Leave Payout\\n8.4.1 For employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, sick leave payout shall\\nbe given to full-time benefitted employees who are members of the Federated\\nRetirement System and who retire with at least fifteen (15) years of service.\\nEmployees are eligible to receive, upon retirement, payout for a portion of\\ntheir unused earned sick leave at the rate of:\\nAMSP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 16\\nAccrued Sick Leave Hours Sick Leave Payout\\n0-399 Hours 50% of final hourly rate\\n400-799 Hours 60% of final hourly rate\\n800-1,200 Hours 75% of final hourly rate\\n8.4.2 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of sick leave payout, an employee’s sick\\nleave balance and hourly rate shall be frozen. This means that an employee\\nwill receive no more in sick leave payout after having met the requirements\\ncontained herein than they would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any\\nsick leave usage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave\\nbalance accrued after June 22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick\\nleave after June 22, 2013, but it may not be used for sick leave payout\\npurposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and their sick leave balance\\nis 1000 hours on June 22, 2013, if they meet eligibility requirements, they\\nshall receive a payout of their sick leave balance at the time of retirement\\nusing the formula above, but no more than 1000 hours and at an hourly rate of\\nno more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently\\nearned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase so that\\ntheir hourly rate is higher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not\\nhave available sick leave to use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses\\nsick leave and reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013, to 800 hours,\\nthey will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours, regardless of\\nany sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This means that if sick leave\\npayout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able to be reestablished in the\\nsick leave balance subject to payout.\\n8.4.3 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for\\nany sick leave payout.\\n8.5 Personal Leave Each eligible full time employee is entitled to sixteen (16) hours of\\nPersonal Leave per payroll calendar year. Eligible employees hired on or after July 1st\\nshall be entitled to eight (8) hours of Personal Leave in the first payroll calendar year of\\nemployment.\\nPart Time: Each benefitted part-time employee shall be entitled to eight (8) hours of\\nPersonal Leave per payroll calendar year. Eligible part-time employees hired on or after\\nJuly 1 shall be entitled to four (4) hours of Personal Leave in the first payroll calendar\\nyear of employment.\\nUnused leave for both full-time and part-time employees does not carry over from year to\\nyear.\\n8.5.1 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an employee on a\\nreduced work week schedule will receive personal leave as indicated in the chart\\nbelow, even if the actual hours worked exceed that amount.\\nAMSP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 17\\nScheduled Work Hours Benefit Level Hours of Personal\\nper Week Leave\\n35-39.9 hours per week 100% 16 hours\\n30-34.9 hours per week 75% 12 hours\\n25-29.9 hours per week 62.5% 10 hours\\n20-24.9 hours per week 50% 8 hours\\nLess than 20 hours per week Unbenefited None\\n8.5.2 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an employee who is\\npromoted into an AMSP-represented classification will have the number of\\nPersonal Leave hours they receive upon promotion reduced on an hour-for-hour\\nbasis based on their usage of Personal Leave and/or Executive Leave within the\\nsame payroll calendar year.\\n8.5.3 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an employee who is\\ndemoted into an AMSP-represented classification will have the number of\\nPersonal Leave hours they receive upon demotion reduced on an hour-for-hour\\nbasis based on their usage of Executive Leave within the same payroll calendar\\nyear.\\n8.6 Bereavement Leave Each full time or benefitted part-time employee shall be granted\\nbereavement leave with full pay for up to forty (40) work hours to attend to the\\ncustomary obligations arising from the death of any of the following relatives of such\\nemployee or employee’s spouse or employee’s domestic partner. All leave must be used\\nwithin thirty (30) calendar days following the death of an eligible person. Under\\nextreme circumstances, the thirty (30) day requirement may be waived by the Director of\\nEmployee Relations. The decision of the Director of Employee Relations shall be final,\\nwith no process for further appeal.\\nParents/Step-parents\\nSpouse/Domestic Partner\\nChild/Step-child\\nBrother/Sister; Step-brother/sister; Half-brother/sister\\nGrandparents/Step-grandparents\\nGreat grandparents/Step-great grandparents\\nGrandchildren\\nSister-in-law/Brother-in-law/Daughter-in-law/Son-in-law\\n8.6.1 A domestic partner, as referenced in Section 8.6, must be the domestic partner\\nregistered with the Department of Human Resources.\\n8.6.2 No eligible employee shall be granted bereavement leave in the event of the\\ndeath of any of the above relatives, if such employee is not scheduled to work\\nwhen such bereavement leave is required.\\n8.7 Jury Duty Each full-time employee, or each part-time employee who is eligible for\\nbenefits, who is required to take time off from duty to serve as a juror in any Court of this\\nAMSP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 18\\nState, or of the United States of America, shall receive the regular base compensation less\\nall jury fees received, excluding mileage. Each employee receiving a notice to report for\\njury service shall immediately notify the immediate supervisor.\\n8.8 Witness Leave\\n8.8.1 Each full-time employee of the City who is required, under subpoena, to take\\ntime off duty with the City, to appear as a witness, by reason of his/her\\nemployment with the City, in any case or proceeding in any Court of this State\\nor of the United States of America, shall receive his/her regular salary during\\nthe term of his/her service as a witness under subpoena, less any and all\\nwitness fees which he/she may receive therefore. Compensation will not be\\npaid if the employee is a party to the action.\\n8.8.2 Upon service of subpoena, an employee shall immediately advise his/her\\nDepartment Director, or supervisor thereof, and of the time when he/she is\\nrequired to appear in Court.\\n8.9 Leaves of Absence\\n8.9.1 All requests for leaves of absence without pay shall be made in writing. The\\nappointing authority, or his/her designated representative, may grant an\\nemployee a leave of absence without pay for good and sufficient reason, not to\\nexceed twelve (12) months. Such leaves may, however, be extended, not to\\nexceed an additional six (6) months, upon written request of the employee,\\nsubject to approval of the appointing authority, or his/her designated\\nrepresentative. Written requests for an extension of a leave shall be submitted\\nprior to the expiration of the leave.\\n8.9.2 Appointing authority may grant leaves of absence without pay for an\\nemployee to work on Union business. Such leaves are subject to all the\\nprovisions in the Article.\\n8.9.3 Any leave granted pursuant to the provisions contained herein may be\\ncanceled by the appointing authority by notice in writing mailed to the\\nemployee at the employee’s address on file in the Human Resources\\nDepartment or such other address as the employee may designate.

Employees may only accrue vacation up to a\\nmaximum of two (2) times their annual accrual rate. Once an employee\\nreaches their maximum accrued vacation limit, the employee will not accrue\\nvacation until their vacation balance falls below the maximum limit.\\nEmployees who currently have accrued vacation balances that are in excess of\\nthe limits below, will maintain their current balance, however they will not\\naccrue vacation until their balance falls below the maximum limit, or have\\nsold back an amount that brings them below their maximum accrual amount.\\nYears of Service Maximum Accrued Vacation\\n1 – 5 240 hours\\n6 – 14 320 hours\\n15+ 400 hours\\n8.2.2.1 Effective calendar year 2016, employees may sell back up to a\\nmaximum of forty (40) hours of accrued vacation per calendar\\nyear.\\n8.2.2.2 Beginning calendar year 2019, employees may sell back up to a\\nmaximum of sixty (60) hours of accrued vacation.\\n8.2.2.3 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations require the City to\\nreport and withhold taxes on the value of the vacation time an\\nemployee is eligible to sell back. In order to ensure compliance\\nwith the IRS requirements and to avoid unanticipated tax\\nconsequences:\\n8.2.2.4 Employees must elect the number of vacation hours they will sell\\nback during a calendar year, up to the maximum of sixty (60)\\nhours, by the end of November of the prior year. If an employee\\ndoes not submit an irrevocable election form to Payroll on or\\nbefore the end of November, the employee will not be eligible to\\nsell back any vacation hours during the next calendar year.\\n8.2.2.5 The election to sell back vacation hours in any year is irrevocable.\\nThis means that employees must sell back the elected number of\\naccrued vacation hours during that year. If the accrued vacation\\nhours are not sold back within the designated calendar year the\\nemployee will be deemed to have received the value of the\\nCAMP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 14\\nvacation hours elected in that calendar year and will be taxed by\\nthe IRS accordingly.\\n8.2.2.6 Employees can elect to sell back only vacation hours accrued\\nduring any given year, and any vacation hours accrued and carried\\nover prior to that year are not eligible for sell back during that year.\\n8.2.2.7 Any vacation hours accrued during that year will not be available\\nfor use until the employee’s accrued vacation hours in that year\\nequal the number of hours the employee has elected to sell back.\\nThose vacation hours accrued in the given year over the number of\\nhours the employee elected to sell back in the given year will be\\navailable for use by the employee. This means that hours elected\\nfor sell back may only be used for sell back purposes and cannot\\nbe used for vacation time off purposes.\\n8.2.2.8 Employees may use any vacation hours accrued and carried over\\nprior to the given year, subject to the normal rules of requesting\\nuse of vacation.\\n8.3 Sick Leave\\n8.3.1 Each part-time and full-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with pay\\nin accordance with the following provisions:\\n8.3.1.1 Sick leave shall accrue in an amount equal to the number of hours\\nworked multiplied by a factor of 0.04616. Paid leave for holidays,\\nvacation, or other paid leave shall be considered as time worked\\nfor purposes of this section.\\n8.3.2 Accrued sick leave may be utilized if the employee is required to be absent\\nfrom work on account of non-job related illness or injury; routine medical or\\ndental appointments; or for the care related to the illness or injury of the\\nemployee’s child, mother, father, spouse or domestic partner registered with\\nthe Department of Human Resources. Up to 48 hours of accrued sick leave\\nper calendar year may be utilized if the employee is required to be absent for\\nthe care related to the illness or injury of the employee’s grandparent,\\ngrandchild, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, stepfather,\\nstepmother or stepchild.\\n8.3.3 Accrued sick leave not to exceed three (3) working days may be granted in\\ncircumstances where an alleged job-related illness or injury is involved, but\\nthe employee fails to provide medical verification of such job-related illness\\nor injury.\\nCAMP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 15\\n8.3.4 Accrued sick leave also may be used in accordance with the Catastrophic\\nIllness Time Donation Program.\\n8.3.5 Except as otherwise provided by resolution of the City Council, paid sick\\nleave shall not be allowed for any absence from work occasioned by\\nintoxication, or use of narcotics not prescribed by a licensed physician.\\n8.3.6 If approved by the City, an employee who is enrolled and participating in a\\nsubstance abuse treatment program may use sick leave for absences resulting\\nfrom participation in such program. The City may require appropriate\\nverification.\\n8.3.7 No employee shall be entitled to or be granted sick leave, either with or\\nwithout pay, unless he or she, or someone on his or her behalf notifies his or\\nher immediate superior or Department Director, of his or her intent to take\\nsuch sick leave due to a personal or family illness prior to the commencement\\nof the sick leave where such notice is possible; provided, however, that the\\nDirector of Employee Relations may waive the requirement of such notice\\nupon presentation of a reasonable excuse by such employee.\\n8.3.8 An employee may be required to furnish substantiation for any absence for\\nwhich sick leave payment is requested.\\n8.3.9 A full-time employee of the City shall be entitled to sick leave without any\\npay if required to be absent from work on account of any non-job related\\nillness, injury or disability, in all situations where such employee is not\\nentitled to sick leave with pay. Any full-time employee who is unable to\\nreturn to work after being absent on paid and/or unpaid sick leave for a\\nmaximum of twelve (12) consecutive months or for a maximum of eighteen\\n(18) cumulative months in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months\\nmay be separated from City service. However, an employee who has reached\\nthis limit may apply for a leave of absence without pay pursuant to Section\\n8.9, Leaves of Absence.\\n8.3.10 Any such part-time employee shall be entitled to paid sick leave only for those\\ndays and number of hours the employee is in fact regularly assigned to work\\nor would have been required to work, notwithstanding the designation,\\nscheduling and indefinite assignment made pursuant to this Article.\\n8.3.11 No eligible part-time employee shall be entitled to sick leave with pay for any\\nday or portion of a day during which the employee is absent, if in fact the\\nemployee is not regularly assigned to work or would not have been required to\\nwork on that day, inclusive of any hours an employee elects to work in\\naddition to their indefinite assignment, notwithstanding the designation,\\nscheduling and indefinite assignment made pursuant to this Article.\\nCAMP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 16\\n8.4 Sick Leave Payout\\n8.4.1 For employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, sick leave payout shall\\nbe given to full-time benefitted employees who are members of the Federated\\nRetirement System and who retire with at least fifteen (15) years of service.\\nEmployees are eligible to receive, upon retirement, payout for a portion of\\ntheir unused earned sick leave at the rate of:\\nAccrued Sick Leave Hours Sick Leave Payout\\n0-399 Hours 50% of final hourly rate\\n400-799 Hours 60% of final hourly rate\\n800-1,200 Hours 75% of final hourly rate\\n8.4.2 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of sick leave payout, an employee’s sick\\nleave balance and hourly rate shall be frozen. This means that an employee\\nwill receive no more in sick leave payout after having met the requirements\\ncontained herein than they would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any\\nsick leave usage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave\\nbalance accrued after June 22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick\\nleave after June 22, 2013, but it may not be used for sick leave payout\\npurposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and their sick leave balance\\nis 1000 hours on June 22, 2013, if they meet eligibility requirements, they\\nshall receive a payout of their sick leave balance at the time of retirement\\nusing the formula above, but no more than 1000 hours and at an hourly rate of\\nno more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently\\nearned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase so that\\ntheir hourly rate is higher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not\\nhave available sick leave to use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses\\nsick leave and reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013, to 800 hours,\\nthey will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours, regardless of\\nany sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This means that if sick leave\\npayout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able to be reestablished in the\\nsick leave balance subject to payout.\\n8.4.3 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for\\nany sick leave payout.\\n8.5 Executive Leave Executive leave is a benefit provided in recognition of the hours in\\nexcess of forty (40) hours per week, which may be necessary but are not directly\\ncompensated on an hourly basis. Executive leave is awarded as hours/days off, up to a\\nmaximum of forty (40) hours/five (5) days during a payroll calendar year. Executive\\nLeave is not an accrued benefit and unused leave does not carry over from year to year.\\nCAMP MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 17\\nThe Management Performance Program (MPP) provides that the Department Director or\\ndesignee may approve up to forty (40) additional hours of executive leave for employees\\nwho receive a performance appraisal of commendable or outstanding.\\n8.5.1 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, when an employee is\\nhired or promoted into a position eligible for Executive Leave, the leave will be\\nprorated during the first year dependent upon the hire date.\\nStart Date in Position Hours of\\nExecutive Leave\\nJanuary 1 – February 28 40 hours\\n(February 29 on a Leap Year)\\nMarch 1 – April 30 32 hours\\nMay 1 – June 30 24 hours\\nJuly 1 – August 31 16 hours\\nSeptember 1 – October 31 8 hours\\nNovember 1 – End of Payroll 0 hours\\nCalendar Year\\n8.5.1.1 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an\\nemployee who is promoted or demoted into a CAMP-represented\\nclassification will have the number of Executive Leave hours they\\nreceive upon promotion or demotion reduced on an hour-for-hour\\nbasis based on their usage of Personal Leave and/or Executive\\nLeave within the same payroll calendar year.\\n8.5.2 Effective the first pay period of payroll calendar year 2022, an employee on a\\nreduced work week schedule will receive executive leave as indicated in the chart\\nbelow, even if the actual hours worked exceed that amount.\\nScheduled Work Hours Benefit Level Hours of\\nper Week Executive Leave\\n35-39.9 hours per week 100% 40 hours\\n30-34.9 hours per week 75% 30 hours\\n25-29.9 hours per week 62.5% 25 hours\\n20-24.9 hours per week 50% 20 hours\\nLess than 20 hours per week Unbenefited None\\n8.5.3 Further details related to Executive Leave, including details related to the use of\\nthe four-hour rule, are contained in City Policy Manual Section 4.2.4, Executive\\nLeave and Absence Policy.\\n8.6 Bereavement Leave Each full time or benefitted part-time employee shall be granted\\nbereavement leave with full pay for up to forty (40) work hours to attend to the\\ncustomary obligations arising from the death of any of the following relatives of such\\nemployee or employee’s spouse or employee’s domestic partner.

Employees shall submit written requests for all vacation leave in advance\\nand as early as practical.\\n17.3 Computation of Vacation Leave\\n17.3.1 For purposes of this Article, paid leave of absence from duty by reason of sick\\nleave, holiday leave, vacation leave, compensatory time-off, personal leave, or\\nany other paid leave, shall be deemed to be \"time worked.\"\\n17.3.2 Prior periods of employment shall be credited to the employee for purposes of\\ndetermining vacation eligibility provided that during each such prior\\nemployment period, the employee achieved permanent status.\\n17.4 Personal Leave\\nEffective the first pay period of each payroll year, each full time employee shall be entitled\\nto a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours per payroll calendar year.

If the employee fails to notify their immediate supervisor, Department\\nDirector, or designee at least one half-hour prior to the commencement of the\\nsick leave, it can result in disciplinary action unless the failure is due to\\nextenuating circumstances extenuating beyond the control of the employee.\\nThe City Manager, or designee, however may waive the requirement of such\\nnotice upon presentation of a reasonable excuse by such employee.\\nDepartments may require an earlier call-in (prior to the start of the shift) where\\nwork crew situation or other Departmental needs require. Departments that\\nrequire early call-in will have a phone recorder or a person assigned to accept\\ncalls with 24-hour coverage.\\n18.1.5 Any time an employee is required to report to work and is unable to report due\\nto illness or injury, an employee may be required to furnish medical verification\\nor other substantiation for any such absence.\\n18.1.6 A full-time employee of the City shall be entitled to sick leave without any pay if\\nrequired to be absent from work on account of any non-job related illness,\\ninjury or disability, including absences of female employees related to\\npregnancy or childbirth in all situations where such employee is not entitled to\\nsick leave with pay. Any full-time employee who is unable to return to work\\nafter being absent on paid and/or unpaid sick leave for eighteen (18)\\nconsecutive or cumulative months in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive\\nmonths shall be considered to have voluntarily resigned. Notwithstanding the\\nforegoing, in no event shall an employee be entitled to a leave of absence\\nwithout pay for a period in excess of twelve (12) cumulative months or for\\ntwelve (12) consecutive months in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive\\nmonths. Any employee who is unable to return to work at the expiration of\\neither of these periods of time shall be considered to have voluntarily\\nseparated from City service. The City shall give the employee reasonable\\nnotice of its intent to apply this rule prior to processing a termination. Such\\nresignation shall be considered a resignation in good standing and the\\nemployee shall therefore be eligible to apply for re-employment pursuant to\\nSan Jose Municipal Code Section 3.04.1530. However, an employee who has\\nreached this limit may apply for a leave of absence without pay pursuant to\\nArticle 13.\\n18.2 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for sick leave\\npayout.\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 30\\n18.3 For employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, a sick leave payout shall be made\\nto full-time employees who are members of the Federated City Retirement System at the\\ntime of retirement or death under one of the following scenarios:\\n18.3.1 Federated Retirement Plan\\nThe employee is:\\n18.3.1.1 a member of the Federated Retirement Plan, and\\n18.3.1.2 retired under the provisions cited in the plan, and\\n18.3.1.3 credited with at least fifteen (15) years of service in this retirement\\nplan, or\\n18.3.1.4 credited with at least ten (10) years of service prior to a disability\\nretirement.\\n18.3.2 Terminated Employee with Vesting Rights\\nThe employee has:\\n18.3.2.1 terminated his/her service with the City, and\\n18.3.2.2 retained vesting rights in a retirement system according to\\nprovisions in the San Jose Municipal Code, and\\n18.3.2.3 following such termination, qualifies for retirement and retires under\\nthe provisions cited in the code, and\\n18.3.2.4 has at the time of retirement credit for at least fifteen (15) years of\\nservice in the applicable retirement plan.\\n18.3.3 Death During Service\\nThe estate of any full-time employee who dies while in City service and prior to\\nretirement, even though the employee is not credited with at least fifteen (15)\\nyears of service in any applicable retirement plan.\\n18.3.4 Death of Terminated Employee\\nThe estate of any full-time employee who:\\n18.3.4.1 had terminated service with the City but had retained vesting rights\\nin a retirement system according to provisions in the San Jose\\nMunicipal Code, and\\n18.3.4.2 dies prior to becoming eligible for retirement allowances as cited\\nunder provisions of the San Jose Municipal Code, and\\n18.3.4.3 has at the time of death credit for at least fifteen (15) years of\\nservice in the applicable retirement plan.\\n18.4 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of calculating a sick leave payout, employees’ sick\\nleave balances and hourly rates shall be frozen. This means that an employee will\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 31\\nreceive no more for a sick leave payout, after having met the requirements set forth\\nabove, than he or she would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave\\nusage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after June\\n22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June 22, 2013, but it may\\nnot be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and his or her sick leave balance is\\n1000 hours on June 22, 2013, then if he or she meets the eligibility requirements\\ncontained herein, the payout of a sick leave balance at the time of retirement will be based\\non the formula below, and shall be based on no more than 1000 hours and an hourly rate\\nof no more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently earned more\\nthan 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase to an hourly rate higher than\\n$40. In this example, if the employee does not have available sick leave to use that was\\naccrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave and reduces their sick leave balance on\\nJune 22, 2013, to 800 hours, they will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours,\\nregardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This means that if sick leave\\npayout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able to be re-established in the sick\\nleave balance subject to payout.\\n18.5 Payout shall be determined as follows: If a full-time employee at the time of his/her\\nretirement or death has earned unused sick leave hours, the employee or Estate shall be\\npaid the equivalent of a specified percent of their hourly rate of pay as of June 22, 2013,\\nmultiplied by the total number of accumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of June\\n22, 2013 (minus any sick leave hours as of June 22, 2013, which were used), as follows:\\nLess than 400 hours: Total hours accumulated x 50% of final hourly rate.\\nor 400 but less than 800 hours: Total hours accumulated x 60% of final hourly rate.\\nor 800 - 1200 hours: Total hours accumulated x 75% of final hourly rate.\\n18.6 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours:\\nFor purposes of determining the total number of accumulated and unused hours of sick\\nleave of a full-time employee at the time of his/her retirement or death, unused sick leave\\nfrom prior periods of employment before June 22, 2013, with the City shall be used.\\nHowever, previously accumulated sick leave shall be credited to the employee for use\\nduring an employee\\'s current employment period.\\nARTICLE 19 DISABILITY LEAVE\\n19.1 Disability Leave Supplement\\nDisability Leave Supplement (DLS) was the benefit provided pursuant to this Article, which\\nwhen added to Workers\\' Compensation Temporary Disability (WCTD) results in providing\\nemployees 85% of their regular base salary. Effective July 7, 2013, employees were no\\nlonger eligible to receive DLS.\\n19.2 Termination of Disability Leave\\nAn employee who is unable to return to full time regular duty following the expiration of\\nany and all leave (and the integration of Sick Leave as provided in Article 18), including\\nthe integration of accrued vacation, compensatory time off, and sick leave as provided in\\nArticle 19.3 and with Workers’ Compensation may be separated from City service.\\n19.3 Integration\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 32\\nThe integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the following order: (1)\\naccrued Vacation hours, (2) earned Compensatory Time once Vacation has been\\nexhausted, and (3) accrued Sick Leave once Vacation and Compensatory Time have\\nbeen exhausted.\\nIn no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any Workers’ Compensation\\nTemporary Disability payments, in excess of the employee’s regular base salary.\\nARTICLE 20 MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP\\n20.1 Employee Rights\\n20.1.1 The City and the Organization recognize the right of employees to form, join, and\\nparticipate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal, alternative right of\\nemployees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee organizations. Neither party\\nshall discriminate against an employee in the exercise of these alternative rights.\\n20.1.2 Accordingly, membership in the Organization shall not be compulsory. An employee has\\nthe right to choose to become a member of the Organization.\\n20.2 Employee’s Obligation to Exclusive Representation\\nThe union will maintain records of employee authorizations for dues deductions. The Union will\\nprovide the City with information regarding the amount of dues deductions and certify the list of\\nUnion employees who have authorized dues deductions. The City will rely on the information\\nprovided by the Union in processing dues deductions for Union members and remit such dues or\\nfees to IBEW. The Union will immediately notify the City of any changes in member dues\\ndeduction authorizations.

Costs\\nto the fund for staff salaries and indirect labor costs shall not exceed 0.17% of\\nassets in the fund per year.\\nIn the event the administrative costs of the Federated Retirement System\\nexceed the administrative cost limit as listed above, representatives from the\\nOffice of Employee Relations, IBEW and the Office of Retirement Services will\\nmeet to discuss the increase in administrative costs.\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 34\\nARTICLE 25 RETIREE HEALTHCARE FUNDING AND BENEFITS\\n25.1 The City and the Union have agreed to transition from the current partial pre-funding of\\nretiree medical and dental healthcare benefits (referred to as the “policy method”) to pre-\\nfunding of the full Annual Required Contribution (ARC) for the retiree healthcare plan\\n(“Plan”). The transition began on June 28, 2009. The Plan’s initial unfunded retiree\\nhealthcare liability shall be fully amortized over a thirty year period so that it shall be paid\\nby June 30, 2039 (closed amortization). Amortization of changes in the unfunded retiree\\nhealthcare liability other than the initial retiree healthcare liability (e.g. gains, losses,\\nchanges in actuarial assumptions, etc.) shall be determined by the Plan’s actuary. The\\nCity and Plan members (active employees) shall contribute to funding the ARC in the ratio\\ncurrently provided under Section 3.28.38of the San Jose Municipal Code. Specifically,\\ncontributions for retiree medical benefits shall be made by the City and members in the\\nratio of one-to-one. Contributions for retiree dental benefits shall be made by the City and\\nmembers in the ratio of eight-to-three. When determining the contribution rates for the\\nPlan, the Plan actuary shall continue to use the Entry Age Normal (EAN) actuarial cost\\nmethod and a discount rate consistent with the pre-funding policy for the Plan as outlined\\nin this Article.\\n25.2 The City and the Union further agree that the Municipal Code and/or applicable plan\\ndocuments shall be amended to the extent necessary in accordance with this agreement\\nand that the Union will support such amendments.\\n25.3 It is understood that in reaching this agreement, the parties have been informed by cost\\nestimates prepared by the Federated City Employees’ Retirement System Board’s actuary\\nand that the actual contribution rates to reach full pre-funding of retiree healthcare will\\ndiffer. The phase-in to the ARC shall be effective on the first pay period of the City’s fiscal\\nyear in each succeeding year effective on June 28, 2009. It is understood that because of\\nchanges resulting from future actuarial valuations, the amount of the ARC may vary\\nupward or downward. The City and Employee Organization agree that retiree healthcare\\ncontribution rates as of June 20, 2015, will remain in effect until December 19, 2015. The\\nCity and plan members shall be contributing the contribution rate based upon the full\\nAnnual Required Contribution, beginning on December 20, 2015. In subsequent fiscal\\nyears, the City and the plan members shall be contributing the full Annual Required\\nContribution in the ratio currently provided under Section 3.28.38 of the San Jose\\nMunicipal Code.\\n25.4 The City has established a qualified 115 trust (“Trust”). Employee contributions will begin\\ngoing into the Trust in time to avoid any potential of reaching the IRS limits on the existing\\nmedical benefits account or upon receipt of a ruling from the IRS that the contributions\\ncan be treated as pre-tax, whichever occurs first.\\n25.5 If employee contributions are deposited into the Trust prior to receiving a ruling from the\\nIRS that the contributions can be treated as pre-tax and the City subsequently receives an\\nIRS determination that the contributions should be treated as post-tax, the City agrees to\\nindemnify any employee as to any IRS liability arising solely from the contributions that\\nwere taken as pre-tax prior to the IRS determination. The City and the Employee\\nOrganization will immediately meet and confer over an alternative trust vehicle for the\\nprospective contributions should the IRS determine that the contributions are post-tax.\\n25.6 It is the objective of the parties that the Trust created pursuant to this agreement shall\\nbecome the sole funding vehicle for Federated retiree healthcare benefits, subject to any\\nlegal restrictions under the current plan, or other applicable law.\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 35\\n25.7 Employees hired into full-time benefited positions on or after the first pay period following\\nthe effective date of the ordinance implementing this provision (“Effective Date”) will not\\nparticipate in or be eligible for the defined benefit retiree healthcare program. The City will\\npay the unfunded liability contribution that these employees and the City would have\\notherwise paid had they gone into the retiree healthcare defined benefit program.\\n25.8 Neither the City nor the Employee Organization waives any rights or assertions, each may\\nhave, related to the retiree healthcare benefit through any of the provisions of this Article.\\nARTICLE 26 TIME DONATION PROGRAMS\\nEmployees may donate time to eligible employees as outlined in the Time Donation Programs\\nsection of the City Policy Manual.\\nARTICLE 27 PROBATIONARY PERIOD\\n27.1 Probationary periods shall not be less than six (6) or twelve (12) months of actual service\\nas determined by the Civil Service Commission. Actual service shall mean regular hours\\nworked, paid holidays and up to 80 hours of other cumulative or consecutive paid or\\nunpaid absences.\\n27.2 An employee\\'s probationary period may be extended at the discretion of the City up to a\\nmaximum of three (3) months of actual and continuous service. The employee will be\\nnotified in writing of the length and reason of the extension. The employee will be\\nprovided with a copy of their performance appraisal and a copy of the memo from the\\nDepartment to Human Resources which outlines the reasons for the request for\\nextension.\\nARTICLE 28 DISCIPLINARY ACTION\\n28.1 The City of San Jose discipline policy is described in City Policy Manual, Section 2.1.3.\\nWhen the need for disciplinary action arises, disciplinary action will be taken\\ncommensurate with the seriousness of the offense. The levels of discipline include\\ninformal actions, which are oral counseling, documented oral counseling and written\\nreprimand. Formal disciplinary actions are suspension, demotion and dismissal.\\n28.2 Step Reduction: As an alternative to suspension, demotion or dismissal, the appointing\\nauthority may reduce an employee\\'s salary step up to no more than two steps in a case\\ninvolving a loss of driving privileges or attendance problems (excluding authorized paid\\nsick leave). The amount and length of time of the salary reduction will be specified in the\\nNotice of Intended Discipline. The salary may be reduced either for a specified period of\\ntime or until the condition which caused the salary reduction has been corrected; e.g.,\\nreinstatement of city driving privileges. The employee may appeal this action, including\\nthe amount and the length of time, to the Civil Service Commission according to the same\\nrules as apply to other formal disciplinary appeals. Reduction of salary step may continue\\nto be used for voluntary settlement agreements.\\n28.3 No provisions of this Article shall be subject to the grievance procedure of this Agreement.\\nThe appeal process for any disciplinary action shall only be those described in the San\\nJose Municipal Code and City Policy Manual, Section 2.1.3 and are not subject to appeal\\nthrough the grievance procedure of this Agreement.\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 36\\nARTICLE 29 ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE\\n29.1 Employees may be eligible for an Alternative Work Schedule, subject to the provisions\\nand conditions in the City of San Jose Alternative Work Schedules Policy. Neither the\\nfailure of the Department to enter into an alternative schedule agreement, nor the\\ntermination by the Department of any such agreement, shall be subject to the Grievance\\nProcedure provided in Article 12.\\nARTICLE 30 NON-DISCRIMINATION\\nThe City and the union agree that they, and each of them, shall not discriminate against any\\nemployees because of membership or lack of membership in the union or because of any\\nauthorized activity on behalf of the union. Further, any claims of discrimination made by a\\nrepresented employee as per this Article 30, may be appealed through the grievance procedure\\noutlined in this agreement.\\nARTICLE 31 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE REFERRAL\\n31.1 Performance problems are sometimes related to personal or work-related problems,\\nwhich may be improved through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). There are four\\nways an employee may be referred to the EAP. The employee may self refer (self\\nreferral), a supervisor may informally remind the employee of the EAP services (informal\\nsupervisory referral), a supervisor may formally discuss the issue with the employee and a\\nmanagement consultant at the EAP (formal supervisory referral), or the supervisor may\\nrequire the employee to attend one initial screening session with the EAP (mandatory\\nreferral).\\n31.2 If a supervisor believes that an employee’s work performance is impaired and can be\\nimproved through the EAP and has declined the formal supervisory referral, he or she,\\nwith Department Director approval, may require the employee to attend one initial\\nscreening session with the EAP.\\n31.3 The employee shall receive paid release time to attend the initial appointment and must\\nsign a Release of Information form that authorizes the EAP provider to release information\\nlimited to dates of service and attendance. Failure to attend or to provide proof of such\\nattendance through the Release of Information form may subject the employee to\\ndisciplinary action. Actual results of the initial screening shall be subject to normal\\nconfidentiality provisions, unless the employee voluntarily signs a release of information\\nform that authorizes release of information beyond dates of service and attendance. The\\nemployee’s decision to attend or not attend follow-up sessions shall be voluntary. Follow-\\nup sessions shall be on the employee’s own time. This may include the approved use of\\nsick leave, vacation, comp-time, or personal leave.\\n31.4 Nothing in this article shall preclude an employee voluntarily agreeing to different\\nconditions as part of a disciplinary settlement agreement.\\nARTICLE 32 ADVANCE NOTICE\\n32.1 The City may adopt, change or modify work rules. Whenever the City changes work rules\\nor issues new work rules, the Union will be given at least five (5) days prior notice, absent\\nemergency, before the effective date, in order that the Union may discuss said rules with\\nthe City before they become effective if the Union so requests.\\nIBEW MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 37\\n32.1.1 When a Department makes a policy change that impacts wages, hours, or\\nterms and conditions of employment, that policy change should first be sent to\\nthe Office of Employee Relations for review prior to implementation. Once\\nreviewed by Employee Relations, pursuant to Article 32.1, said changes\\nshould be provided to the Union for review.\\nARTICLE 33 EMPLOYEE COMMUTE BENEFIT PROGRAM\\nThe Employee Commute Benefit Program shall be as follows:\\n33.1 Full-time, and part-time employees who worked an average of twenty (20) or more hours\\nper week within the previous calendar month, shall be eligible to participate in the\\nEmployee Commute Benefit Program. Seasonal workers and Airport employees are not\\neligible to participate in the Employee Commute Benefit Program; the Airport provides its\\nown separate employee commute program.\\n33.2 Participation in the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority (\"VTA\") Eco Pass Program will be\\navailable to eligible employees, subject to the terms of the Employee Commute Benefit\\nProgram as defined in Article 33.1.\\n33.3 Pursuant to the Employee Commute Benefit Program, eligible employees shall be allowed\\nto use pre-tax dollars (\"Pre-Tax Payroll Deduction Program\") to pay for transit service\\nbeyond those provided by VTA. The administrative fees of the Pre-Tax Payroll Deduction\\nProgram will be paid for by the City. The Pre-Tax Payroll Deduction Program shall enable\\nemployees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for non-VTA transit services, which may include,\\nbut are not limited to, Caltrain, the Hwy 17 Express Bus, and BART.\\nARTICLE 34 UNION RELEASE TIME\\n34.1 City Paid Union Release Time (URT).

Any sick leave usage after June 22, 2013, will\\ncome first from the sick leave balance accrued after June 22,\\n2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June\\n22, 2013, but it may not be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $20 and the\\nemployee’s sick leave balance is 250 hours on June 22, 2013,\\nthen if the employee meets the eligibility requirements\\ncontained herein, the payout of a sick leave balance at the time\\nof retirement will be based on the formula below, and shall be\\nbased earned on no more than 250 hours and an hourly rate of\\nno more than $20. This will occur even if the employee has\\nsubsequently earned more than 250 hours in sick leave or\\nreceived a pay increase to an hourly rate higher than $20. In\\nthis example, if the employee does not have available sick leave\\nto use that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick\\nleave and reduces their sick leave balance on June 22, 2013,\\nto 50 hours, they will only be entitled to a sick leave payout of\\n50 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22,\\n2013. This means that if sick leave payout hours are reduced\\nby usage, they are not able to be re-established in the sick leave\\nbalance subject to payout.\\n10.3.6.4 Payout shall be determined as follows.\\n10.3.6.4.1 Payout shall be determined as follows: If a full-\\ntime or eligible part-time employee at the time of\\nretirement or death has earned unused sick\\nleave hours, the employee or Estate shall be\\npaid the equivalent of a specified percent of their\\nhourly rate of pay as of June 22, 2013, multiplied\\nby the total number of accumulated and unused\\nhours of sick leave as of June 22, 2013 (minus\\nany sick leave hours as of June 22, 2013, which\\nwere used), as follows:\\n10.3.6.4.2 Less than 400 hours - Hours accumulated x\\n50% of final hourly\\nrate;\\nMEF MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2023 Page 30\\nor 400 - 799 hours - Hours accumulated x\\n60% of final hourly\\nrate;\\nor 800 - 1200 hours - Hours accumulated x\\n75% of final hourly\\nrate.\\n10.3.6.5 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours. For purposes\\nof determining the total number of accumulated and unused\\nhours of sick leave of a full-time employee at the time of\\nretirement or death, unused sick leave from prior periods of\\nemployment before June 22, 2013, with the City shall be used.\\nHowever, previously accumulated sick leave shall be credited\\nto the employee for use during an employee’s current\\nemployment period.\\n10.4 Disability Leave\\n10.4.1 Termination of Disability Leave.

The integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the\\nfollowing order: (a) accrued Vacation hours, (2) earned Compensatory Time\\nonce Vacation has been exhausted, and (3) accrued Sick Leave once\\nVacation and Compensatory Time have both been exhausted.\\n10.4.2.1 In no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any\\nWorkers’ Compensation Temporary Disability payments, in\\nexcess of the employee’s regular base salary.\\n10.5 Bereavement Leave.

Practical - The Voluntary Phase is nearly identical to the PAY CAR Program, which was being\\nused by the Administrative Unit\\n3. Effective - Strategic, Long Term, with the advent of eResource\\n4. This Mandatory Overtime Policy will expire; either at the time the Police Department is staffed\\nwith 1109 Officers or the Patrol Division is not experiencing a problem with filling patrol\\npositions.\\n5. All voluntary overtime shifts worked as part of this program will be for pay only. Mandatory\\nshifts worked as part of this program will be for pay or compensatory time, as determined by the\\nOfficer.\\nII. The Bidding Process\\n\\uf0b7 The First Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is VOLUNTARY\\n\\uf0b7 The Second Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is VOLUNTARY\\n\\uf0b7 The Third Phase of the OOT Bidding Process is MANDATORY\\n\\uf0b7 The Bidding cycle will cover approximately 3 months\\n\\uf0b7 The Third Phase (Mandatory) of the bidding process will only occur if there are unfilled pay car\\npositions at the conclusion of the First and Second Phases (Voluntary) as designated by the\\nBFO Administrative Unit\\n1. First “Voluntary Phase” (Voluntary)\\nAt the beginning of each bidding cycle, the BFO Administrative Unit will:\\n\\uf0b7 Determine the number of voluntary back-fill pay cars that Officers need to volunteer for to\\nexempt them from the mandatory phase of the cycle (See Section V below).\\n\\uf0b7 The above number will be based on the total number of pay cars available and the number\\nof full duty Officers eligible to work at the time.\\n\\uf0b7 Back-fill pay cars will be offered to Officers in order of seniority starting from the most senior\\nto the most junior, based on departmental seniority.\\n\\uf0b7 Determine the maximum number of voluntary back-fill pay cars that will be offered to each\\nofficer for that cycle\\n\\uf0b7 An Officer can choose to work any shift that is open and is not required to stay on his or her\\nnormal shift.\\nRevised Date: January 11, 2017\\nOriginal Effective Date: August 25, 2015\\nPage 1 of 6\\nSan Jose Police Department\\nOvertime Staffing Plan\\n\\uf0b7 An Officer may volunteer for as many pay cars as they desire as long as they comply with\\nestablished secondary employment restrictions as defined in Duty Manual Sections C 1540\\n– C 1541.

The Officer will numerically rank the mandatory overtime shifts in descending\\norder to reflect the shifts they would prefer to work the most.\\n\\uf0b7 eResource will assign Officers their mandatory overtime shifts based on their departmental\\nseniority and, if possible, the identified preferences for the days they would most like work.\\nThe BFO Administrative Unit cannot guarantee that every Officer will get their first choice.\\n\\uf0b7 Officers who have scheduled time off will be exempted from the Mandatory Assignment\\nPhase during their time off (See Section III below).\\nExample:\\n1. The BFO Administrative Unit determines there is a need for 50 back-fill pay cars during the\\nscheduling cycle.\\n2. During the Phase One and Phase Two bidding process (Voluntary), eResource will be\\nutilized to allow Officers to volunteer to work as many of the back-fill pay cars as they like up\\nto 30 hours per week (See Duty Manual Sections C1540-C1541).\\n3. If an Officer volunteers for the number of back-fill pay cars required to exempt themselves\\nduring the voluntary bidding process, they will not be required to participate in the Phase\\nTwo bidding process (Mandatory).\\n4. If 40 of the 50 available pay car positions are filled during the voluntary bidding process, 10\\nwould be left to fill during the mandatory bidding process.\\n5. 10 Officers will be mandated to fill the remaining 10 pay car positions by reverse seniority.\\n6. The bidding process will take two weeks to complete and will include one week for the BFO\\nAdministrative Unit to find replacements if they need to before the first back-fill pay car is\\nstarted in the next cycle.\\nIII. Specifics about the Mandatory Phase\\n1. A reverse seniority process will be created for each day of the week. Officers may only be\\nmandated to work the shift he or she is currently working, except Officers working day shift may\\nbe mandated to work the swing shift.\\n2. eResource will account for which Officers are on pre-planned time-off (vacation, time off, FMLA,\\netc.) and Officers will not be scheduled during those times with the following guidelines\\nRevised Date: January 11, 2017\\nOriginal Effective Date: August 25, 2015\\nPage 3 of 6\\nSan Jose Police Department\\nOvertime Staffing Plan\\n\\uf0b7 Officers taking 40 hours or more of vacation will be given the three days off before and after\\nthe 40 hour or more period so they will not be eligible as part of the mandatory overtime\\nduring that period of time.\\n\\uf0b7 Time periods of less than a full 40-hours will not include the days off before or after that\\nperiod of time, unless a specific request has been made to the BFO Deputy Chief and the\\nBFO Deputy Chief or his/her designee has authorized such.\\n3. If there are remaining slots which need to be filled during the “Mandatory Phase” eResource will\\nidentify Officers with the least amount of seniority to fill those slots. (i.e., if there are 5 slots that\\nneed to be filled through the “Mandatory Assignment Phase” the 5 Officers with the least\\nseniority, that have not previously been taken off the list during that list cycle, will be assigned).\\n4. The five Officers who were mandated to work will not be mandated to work again until the rest\\nof the “reverse seniority list” is exhausted.\\n5. Every officer will eventually get mandated to work, unless they have been taken off of the\\n“Mandatory List” because they volunteered for the required amount of pay cars to exempt them.\\nOfficers will be given a minimum two weeks’ notice when they are mandated to work a pay car.\\n6. If an officer cannot work his/her mandated overtime shift due to a hardship, the BFO\\nAdministrative Unit is responsible for finding their replacement. If an officer trades away their\\nmandatory shift, calls in sick for their mandatory shift or cannot work it for any other reason, they\\nwill remain on the mandatory list until they actually work a mandatory shift.\\n7. No officer will work more than 3 mandatory shifts within two pay periods.\\n8. All overtime policies will be enforced (specifically C1540 & C1541), unless otherwise specified\\nherein. For example, if an Officer works day shift with FSS off, he/she will not be mandated to\\nwork a midnight shift on Sunday (violation of the maximum 16 hours in a 24 hour period –\\nC1541).\\n\\uf0b7 Department members shall not work in excess of thirty (30) hours of secondary\\nemployment assignments in one calendar week.

What if I have to work a mandatory shift on a Sunday on 3rd Watch and I have to be back at work on\\nMonday morning for my regular shift?\\nOfficers can volunteer to work any shift during the Voluntary Phase. Additionally, Officers can be\\nmandated to work the shift he or she is currently working, and Officers working day shift may be\\nmandated to work the swing shift.

If the\\nemployee fails to notify their immediate supervisor, Department Director, or\\ndesignee at least one-half hour prior to the commencement of the sick leave, it\\ncan result in disciplinary action unless the failure is due to extenuating\\ncircumstances extenuating beyond the control of the employee. The City\\nManager or designee, however, may waive the requirement of such notice upon\\npresentation of a reasonable excuse by such employee. Upon written approval\\nby the Office of Employee Relations and the OE#3 Union, departments may\\nrequire an earlier call-in where work crew situations or other departmental needs\\nrequire.\\n19.1.5 Any time an employee is required to report to work and is unable to report due to\\nillness or injury, an employee may be required to furnish medical verification or\\nother substantiation for any such absence.\\n19.1.6 A full-time employee of the City shall be entitled to sick leave without any pay if\\nrequired to be absent from work on account of any non-job-related illness, injury\\nor disability, including absences of female employees related to pregnancy or\\nchildbirth, in all situations where such employee is not entitled to sick leave with\\npay. Any full-time employee who is unable to return to work after being absent\\non paid and/or unpaid sick leave for a maximum of eighteen (18) consecutive or\\nfor eighteen (18) cumulative months in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive\\nmonths shall be separated from City service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\\nno event shall an employee be entitled to a leave of absence without pay for a\\nperiod in excess of twelve (12) cumulative months or for twelve (12) consecutive\\nmonths in any period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months. Any employee\\nwho is unable to return to work at the expiration of either of these periods of time\\nshall be considered to have voluntarily separated from City service.\\n19.1.7 Accrued sick leave may also be used in accordance with the Catastrophic Illness\\nprovisions contained in this MOA.\\n19.1.8 When an employee has exhausted all of his/her sick leave, the employee may\\nbe allowed to use accrued vacation or compensatory time in lieu of unpaid time\\nsubject to the approval of the Department Director or designee and pursuant to\\n19.1.5 above, may require medical verification.\\n19.2 Any employee hired on or after September 30, 2012, shall not be eligible for sick leave\\npayout.\\n19.3 For employees hired on or before September 29, 2012, a sick leave payout shall be\\nmade to full-time and part-time benefitted employees who are members of the Federated\\nCity Retirement System at the time of retirement or death under one of the following\\nscenarios:\\nPOPRA MOA January 1, 2020 – June 30, 2023 Page 30\\n19.3.1 Federated Retirement Plan. The employee is: a) a member of the Federated\\nRetirement Plan, and; b) retired under the provisions cited in the plan, and; c)\\ncredited with at least 15 years of service in this retirement plan, or; d) credited\\nwith at least 10 years of service prior to a disability retirement.\\n19.3.2 Separated Employee with Vesting Rights. The employee has: a) separated from\\nservice with the City and has not been terminated for cause as defined by San\\nJose Municipal Code (SJMC) Section 3.04.1370 and; b) retained vesting rights in\\na retirement system according to provisions in the SJMC, and; c) following such\\nseparation, qualifies for retirement and retires under the provisions cited in the\\ncode, and; d) has at the time of retirement credit for at least 15 years of service in\\nthe applicable retirement plan.\\n19.3.3 Death During Service. The estate of any full-time employee who dies while in\\nCity service and prior to retirement, even though the employee is not credited\\nwith at least 15 years of service in any applicable retirement plan.\\n19.3.4 Death of Separated Employee. The estate of any full-time employee who: a)\\nhas separated from service with the City and has not been terminated for cause\\nas defined by San Jose Municipal Code (SJMC) Section 3.04.1370 but had\\nretained vesting rights in a retirement system according to provisions in the\\nSJMC, and; b) dies prior to becoming eligible for retirement allowances as cited\\nunder provisions of the SJMC, and; c) has at the time of death credit for at least\\n15 years of service in the applicable retirement plan.\\n19.4 Effective June 22, 2013, for purposes of calculating a sick leave payout, employees’ sick\\nleave balances and hourly rates shall be frozen. This means that an employee will\\nreceive no more for a sick leave payout, after having met the requirements set forth\\nabove, than he or she would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave\\nusage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after June\\n22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June 22, 2013, but it may\\nnot be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and his or her sick leave balance is\\n1000 hours on June 22, 2013, then if he or she meets the eligibility requirements\\ncontained herein, the payout of a sick leave balance at the time of retirement will be\\nbased on the formula below, and shall be based on no more than 1000 hours and an\\nhourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently\\nearned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase to an hourly rate\\nhigher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not have available sick leave to\\nuse that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave and reduces their sick\\nleave balance on June 22, 2013, to 800 hours, they will only be entitled to a sick leave\\npayout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This\\nmeans that if sick leave payout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able to be re-\\nestablished in the sick leave balance subject to payout.\\n19.5 Payout shall be determined as follows.\\n19.5.1 Payout shall be determined as follows: If a full-time or eligible part-time\\nemployee at the time of retirement or death has earned unused sick leave hours,\\nthe employee or estate shall be paid the equivalent of a specified percent of their\\nhourly rate of pay as of June 22, 2013, multiplied by the total number of\\naccumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of June 22, 2013 (minus any sick\\nPOPRA MOA January 1, 2020 – June 30, 2023 Page 31\\nleave hours as of June 22, 2013, which were used), as follows:\\n19.5.2 Less than 400 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n50% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013;\\nor 400 - 799 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n60% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013;\\nor 800 - 1200 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n75% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013.\\n19.6 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours. For purposes of determining the total\\nnumber of accumulated and unused hours of sick leave of a full-time employee at the\\ntime of retirement or death, unused sick leave from prior periods of employment before\\nJune 22, 2013, with the City shall be used. However, previously accumulated sick leave\\nshall be credited to the employee for use during an employee’s current employment\\nperiod.\\nARTICLE 20 DISABILITY LEAVE\\n20.1 Disability Leave Supplement (DLS). Disability Leave Supplement (DLS) was the benefit\\nprovided pursuant to this Article, which, when added to Worker\\'s Compensation\\nTemporary Disability (WCTD), resulted in providing employees 85% of their regular base\\nsalary. Effective April 27, 2014, employees were no longer eligible to receive DLS.\\n20.2 Termination of Disability Leave. An employee who is unable to return to full time regular\\nduty following the expiration of any and all leave (and the integration of Sick Leave as\\nprovided for in Article 19.1.2.3) including the integration of accrued vacation,\\ncompensatory time, and sick leave as provided in Article 19.3, with Workers’\\nCompensation may be considered to have voluntarily separated from employment.\\n20.3 Integration. The integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the following\\norder: (1) accrued Vacation hours, (2) earned Compensatory Time once Vacation has\\nbeen exhausted, and (3) accrued Sick Leave once Vacation and Compensatory Time\\nhave both been exhausted.\\n• In no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any Workers’\\nCompensation Temporary Disability payments, in excess of the employee’s\\nregular base salary.\\nARTICLE 21 MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP\\n21.1 Employee Rights.\\n21.1.1 The City and the Organization recognize the right of employees to form, join, and\\nparticipate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal,\\nalternative right of employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee\\norganizations. Neither party shall discriminate against an employee in the\\nexercise of these alternative rights.\\nPOPRA MOA January 1, 2020 – June 30, 2023 Page 32\\n21.1.2 Accordingly, membership in the Organization shall not be compulsory. An\\nemployee has the right to choose to become a member of the Organization.\\n21.2 Employee\\'s Obligation to Exclusive Representation.\\nThe union will maintain records of employee authorizations for dues deductions.

The City will\\nrely on the information provided by the Union in processing dues deductions for Union\\nmembers and remit such dues or fees to OE#3. The Union will immediately notify the\\nCity of any changes in member dues deduction authorizations. The City will direct all\\ninquiries from employees about union membership or dues deductions to the Union.\\n21.3 Hold Harmless.

An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after\\nJune 20, 2015, but it may not be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate was $40 as of June 21, 2014, and their\\nsick leave balance is 1000 hours on June 20, 2015, if they meet eligibility\\nrequirements, they shall receive payout of their sick leave balance at the time of\\nretirement using the formula below, but no more than 1000 hours and at an hourly\\nrate of no more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently\\nearned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase so that their\\nhourly rate is higher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not have\\navailable sick leave to use that was accrued after June 20, 2015, and uses sick leave\\nand reduces their sick leave balance on June 20, 2015, to 800 hours, they will only\\nbe entitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued\\nafter June 20, 2015.\\nPayout shall be determined as follows:\\nIAFF MOA \\uf0b7 July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2023 - 33 -\\n(a) If such full-time employee, at the time of retirement or death, shall have\\naccumulated and has to their credit less than four-hundred (400) hours, or five-\\nhundred sixty (560) hours for any full-time employee who is assigned to twenty\\nfour (24) hour shifts, of earned unused sick leave, the employee or their estate,\\nshall be paid a sum of money equal to fifty percent (50%) of the employee’s\\nhourly rate of pay at the time of death, retirement, or termination, whichever is\\nearlier, multiplied by the total number of the employee’s accumulated and\\nunused hours of sick leave as of the date of death or retirement;\\n(b) If such full-time employee, at the time of retirement or death, shall have\\naccumulated and has to their credit, at least four-hundred (400) hours, or five-\\nhundred sixty (560) hours for any full-time employee who is assigned to twenty-\\nfour (24) hour shifts, but less than eight-hundred (800) hours, or one-thousand\\none-hundred twenty (1,120) hours for any full-time employee who is assigned to\\ntwenty-four (24) hour shifts, of earned unused sick leave, the employee or their\\nestate, shall be paid a sum of money equal to sixty percent (60%) of the\\nemployee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of death, retirement or termination,\\nwhichever is earlier, multiplied by the total number of the employee’s\\naccumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of the date of death or\\nretirement;\\n(c) If such full-time employee, at the time of retirement or death, shall have\\naccumulated and has to their credit at least eight-hundred (800) hours, or one-\\nthousand one-hundred twenty (1,120) hours for any full-time employee who is\\nassigned to twenty-four (24) hour shifts, but less than one-thousand two-\\nhundred one (1,201) hours, or one-thousand six-hundred eighty (1,680) for any\\nfull-time employee who is assigned to twenty-four (24) hours shifts, of earned\\nunused sick leave, the employee or their estate, shall be paid a sum of money\\nequal to eighty percent (80%) of the employee’s hourly rate of pay at the time of\\ndeath, retirement or termination, whichever is earlier, multiplied by the total\\nnumber of the employee’s accumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of\\nthe date of death or retirement;\\n(d) If a full-time employee, at the time of service retirement or death, has\\naccumulated and has to their credit at least one-thousand two-hundred one\\n(1,201) hours, or one-thousand six-hundred eighty (1,680) hours for any full-\\ntime employee who is assigned to twenty-four (24) hour shifts, or greater of\\nearned unused sick leave, the employee or their estate, shall be paid a sum of\\nmoney equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of the employee’s hourly rate of\\npay at the time of death or service, whichever is earlier, multiplied by the total\\nnumber of accumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of the date of death\\nor retirement. If after retirement the employee switches from service to\\ndisability retirement, the employee shall repay to the City the difference in sick\\nleave payout between service and disability retirement (e.g. one-hundred\\npercent (100%) service, eighty percent (80%) disability).\\n26.2.4 For purposes of payment of accumulated sick leave as provided in this Article, sick\\nleave accumulated during prior periods of employment shall be credited to the\\nemployee.

However, the\\nmethod of proceeding to Immediate Arbitration must be done\\nconsistent with the following provisions.\\n25.6.2 The arbitration shall take place no earlier than the fifteenth day\\nfollowing the request by the grieving party for such \"Immediate\\nArbitration,\" unless otherwise mutually agreed.

The non-neutral\\nmembers of the Board shall be chosen as provided in Section 1111.\\nThe Board shall conduct \"mediation/arbitration.\" The Parties\\ncontemplate the sort of \"mediation/arbitration\" as the process is\\ntraditionally used in the San Francisco Bay Area. This process shall\\nconstitute issue by issue, last best offer arbitration proceedings as\\ndescribed in Charter Section 1111.\\n25.7.2 The parties herein contemplate eliminating the additional time and\\nexpense that would occur if a separate arbitrator had to be chosen\\nSJPOA MOA July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025 Page 40\\nunder Section 1111 to hear/resolve the dispute in a separate\\nproceeding.\\n25.8 Disciplinary Grievances\\n25.8.1 Employees in the bargaining unit shall only be disciplined for cause.\\nDiscipline is defined to include those matters that are cognizable\\nbefore the Civil Service Commission plus disciplinary transfers.\\n25.8.1.1 The San José Municipal Code defines disciplinary action as\\ndismissal, demotion and suspension.

However, should a particular DOC be the\\nresult of the Assistant Chief\\'s having reduced a higher form of\\ndiscipline to a DOC with which the affected officer is still dissatisfied,\\nsuch DOC may be appealed to the level of the Chief of Police. DOCs\\nreceived for preventable, automobile accidents shall not be appealable\\nunless the officer contends that the accident was not preventable.\\n25.8.5 Nothing herein constitutes a waiver of rights of employees otherwise\\ngranted by law (e.g., Government Code Sections 3300 et. seq.).\\n25.8.6 An employee challenging a suspension, demotion, dismissal, salary\\nstep reduction or disciplinary transfer shall have the option of choosing\\nbetween the dispute-resolution provisions of this Agreement, or appeal\\nto the Civil Service Commission. Any employee who wishes to\\npreserve the right of appeal to the Commission must comply with the\\ntime requirements for filing such appeal as specified in the Civil\\nService Rules.

The published version of the arbitrator’s award\\nwill redact the name and any other identifying features of\\nthe officer to preserve confidentiality. The opportunity to\\nappeal to the Civil Service Commission shall fulfill the\\nCity’s obligations to provide an administrative appeal\\npursuant to Government Code section 3304.\\n25.8.7 The employee shall confirm their election of remedies in writing to the\\nDirector of Employee Relations. If the employee files an appeal to the\\nCivil Service Commission and also an appeal through the grievance\\nprocedure of this Agreement within the required timelines, the election\\nof remedies must be made no later than 45 days from the date of the\\nNotice of Discipline. The election of remedies must also be made prior\\nto the submission of a request for a list of arbitrators and prior to\\nscheduling a Civil Service Commission appeal hearing. As otherwise\\nprovided in this Agreement, for the matter to go to binding arbitration,\\nthe POA must agree (i.e., must be the party taking the matter to\\narbitration).\\n25.9 Disciplinary Procedures\\n25.9.1 The disciplinary procedures that shall apply to members of this\\nbargaining unit are contained in the City’s Discipline Policy (2.1.3) of the\\nCity’s Administrative Policy Manual, and incorporated herein by\\nreference, with the following modifications:\\n25.9.2 With respect to the “Skelly Conference,” given the particular importance\\nof prompt investigations and disciplinary action with respect to peace\\nofficers, and in order to avoid undue delays, the Skelly Conference must\\noccur within thirty (30) days of the date the Notice of Intent to Discipline\\n(NOID) with supporting materials is issued by the City.

If the arbitrator/neutral was chosen by the\\nCity, the City may replace that arbitrator/neutral with another panelist\\nfrom CSMCS or JAMS. If the arbitrator was chosen by the POA, the\\nPOA can select another panelist from CSMCS.\\nSJPOA MOA July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025 Page 43\\n25.11 General Provisions of Grievance Procedure\\n25.11.1.

This means that an\\nemployee will receive no more in sick leave payout after having met the\\nrequirements contained herein than they would have been entitled to on\\nJuly 6, 2013. Any sick leave usage after July 6, 2013, will come first\\nfrom the sick leave balance accrued after July 6, 2013. An employee will\\ncontinue to accrue sick leave after July 6, 2013, but it may not be used\\nfor sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and their sick leave\\nbalance is 1000 hours on July 6, 2013, if they meet eligibility\\nrequirements, they shall receive payout of their sick leave balance at the\\ntime of retirement using the formula below, but no more than 1000 hours\\nand at an hourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even if the\\nemployee has subsequently earned more than 1000 hours in sick leave\\nor received a pay increase so that their hourly rate is higher than $40. In\\nthis example, if the employee does not have available sick leave to use\\nthat was accrued after July 6, 2013, and uses sick leave and reduces\\ntheir sick leave balance on July 6, 2013, to 800 hours, they will only be\\nentitled to a sick leave payout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave\\naccrued after July 6, 2013.\\nSJPOA MOA July 1, 2022 – June 30, 2025 Page 55\\nPayout shall be determined as follows:\\n31.2.5.1 If a full-time employee at the time of their retirement or death\\nhas earned, unused sick leave hours, they shall be paid the\\nequivalent of a specified percent of their hourly rate of pay at\\nthe time of retirement, termination or death, whichever\\ncomes first, multiplied by the total number of their\\naccumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of the date\\nof their retirement or death.\\nLess than 400 hours: Hours accumulated x 50%\\nof final hourly rate\\nor, 400 – 799 hours: Hours accumulated x 60%\\nof final hourly rate\\nor, 800 – 1200 hours: Hours accumulated x 75%\\nof final hourly rate.\\n31.2.5.2 If a full-time employee at the time of their service retirement\\nhas between 800 and 1,200 hours of unused sick leave, at\\nthe employee’s request they shall be paid hours\\naccumulated X 80% of final hourly rate.\\n31.2.5.3 If a full-time employee at the time of their service retirement\\nor upon the employee’s death has 1,200 hours or greater of\\nearned unused sick leave, they, or their estate, shall be paid\\na sum of money equal to 100% percent of their hourly rate at\\nthe time of their death or service retirement, whichever is\\nearlier, multiplied by the total number of their accumulated\\nand unused hours of sick leave as of the date of their death\\nor retirement.

To this end, it\\nhas established this policy to regulate the transfer of sergeants between assignments throughout\\nthe Department. The Department has formed an advisory committee, known as the “Personnel\\nAdvisory Committee” (PAC) to assist in policy development which shall be beneficial to the\\nDepartment and to the individual Sergeant. The PAC does not have the power to alter\\nDepartment policy.\\nThe purpose of this document is to establish a “Sergeants’ Transfer Policy” for the rank of\\nSergeant. The “Sergeants’ Transfer Policy” affects the San Jose Police Department’s four (4)\\nBureaus (BFO/BOI/BOA/BTS) as well as assignments which fall under the purview of the\\nOffice of the Chief of Police. This policy shall deal with “Inter-Bureau Transfers” only and\\nshall not involve specific units. “Intra-Bureau Transfers” shall be established by the individual\\nBureau Chiefs; however, sections in this policy do discuss specifics regarding the total amount\\nof time that an individual sergeant can spend out of the BFO Patrol function, including\\nsituations where sergeants have either voluntarily or involuntarily been the subject of an “Intra-\\nBureau” transfer.\\nThe intended effective date of this revised policy will be at the BFO shift change, September\\nof 2016.\\nPROCEDURE\\nELIMINATION OF EXISTING SIX (6) YEAR LID\\nEffective immediately, all sergeants that are currently assigned outside the BFO Patrol function\\nwill abide by the guidelines as set forth in this policy.

The use of the BWC system provides\\ndocumentary evidence for park patrol, protection, and enforcement of state and municipal laws\\nand park rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, issuing citations, making arrests and\\nperforming parking control activities and interactions with park visitors except as otherwise noted.\\nDEFINITIONS\\nPower On / Off — The process of powering on or off the recording device. This merely turns the\\nBWC on or off and does not refer to recording. When powered on, the BWC is in buffering mode\\nand capturing only 30 seconds of video but does not save the recording to memory unless the\\ncamera is activated.\\nRecording on / Activating — The process of recording video and/or audio to memory on the\\ndevice.\\nRecording off / Deactivating — The process of stopping the recording. This discontinues the\\nrecording being saved to memory on the device but does not prevent the device from buffering.\\nBODY WORN CAMERAS-GENERAL PROVISIONS\\nThe Department adopts the use of BWCs to record interactions between Park Rangers and the\\npublic. Park Rangers shall utilize BVVCs in accordance with the provisions of this policy.\\nUSER TRAINING\\nThe Department shall ensure that each Park Ranger is trained in the use of the BWC prior to\\nissuance and deployment.

If a device is in need of repair, Park Rangers will notify their supervisor\\nand turn the BWC into the Supervising Park Ranger for repair or replacement. Actual time spent\\ntesting or reporting damage to a BWC shall be regarded as time worked.\\nNote: This section is inclusive of all uniform types including Bicycle Patrol, ATV Patrol, and Boat\\nPatrol.\\nPark Rangers should wear the BWC on their uniform at a location that will facilitate an optimum\\nrecording field of view. This location may vary from Park Ranger to Park Ranger based upon their\\nspecific uniform and body composition.\\nPark Rangers will ‘power on’ the BWC before going into service and keep it powered on for the\\nremainder of their shift, with the exception of bathroom breaks or those times when a Park Ranger\\nis entering a Department changing room. Outside of these two exceptions, the Park Ranger will\\nonly ‘power off’ their BWC at the conclusion of their shift prior to placing it in a docking station to\\nupload.\\nNote: Exceptions to this rule are certain incidents referenced in the Procedures Related to\\nViewing BWC Footage Prior to Making Statements section of this policy.

This does not apply to crimes\\nin progress or other circumstances that would allow the Park Ranger to be lawfully present without\\na warrant.\\nVICTIM AND WITNESS STATEMENTS\\nWhen conducting an investigation, the Park Ranger shall attempt to record the victim or witness\\nstatement with the BWC. The recording may be valuable evidence that contributes to or\\ncomplements an investigation. While evidence collection is important, the Department also\\nrecognizes it is important for Park Rangers to maintain credibility with people wanting to share\\ninformation.\\nShould a Park Ranger encounter a reluctant victim or witness who does not wish to make a\\nstatement on camera, the Park Ranger shall use discretion and not record the victim or witness\\nstatement with the BWC, but document on camera the reason for not fully recording the statement\\nwith the BWC. The BWC should be reactivated as soon as practicable after the victim or witness\\nstatement is provided.\\nUNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND USE\\nAll BWC recordings shall remain the property of the Department and constitute official records of\\ninvestigation of the Department.\\nUnauthorized access to, use, duplication, and/or distribution of BWC files is prohibited.

Performance of non-enforcement functions or administrative duties within a department\\nfacility.\\nPersonally owned BWCs shall not be used while on duty.\\nNote: All activity related to BWC video files are automatically tracked in the evidence management\\nsystem’s audit trail. This information includes: the person accessing the file(s), the date and time\\nof access, the activity that was performed, and the specific IP address from which the file(s) were\\naccessed.\\nACCIDENTAL RECORDINGS\\nIn the event of an accidental activation of the BWC where the resulting recording is of no\\ninvestigative or evidentiary value, the recording Park Ranger may request that the BWC video be\\ndeleted. The Park Ranger will submit a request for deletion via email, with sufficient information\\nto locate the BWC file, to their direct supervisor.\\nThe email will be forwarded through the Park Ranger’s chain of command to their Supervising\\nPark Ranger. The receiving Supervising Park Ranger shall review the file and approve or deny\\nthe request. The Supervising Park Ranger will ensure the file(s) is not associated with a public\\ncontact or CAD event. No files associated with an official Park Ranger contact, CAD event, or any\\npending litigation or complaint are eligible for deletion.\\nShould the Supervising Park Ranger approve the request, they will send an email to the Deputy\\nDirector — Parks Division with the reason for the deletion, including the authorizing authority. Only\\nSupervising Park Rangers, with the approval of the Deputy Director — Parks Division shall delete\\nthe files. The reason for the deletion, including the authorizing authority, will be documented in\\nthe notes of the videos. These notes are retained by the evidence management system’s audit\\ntrail. Deletions and requests for deletion are tracked by the Supervising Park Rangers’ Office.\\nPark Rangers will not request deletion of BWC files that are not the result of an accident. Should\\nthe Park Ranger knowingly or unknowingly record something of a confidential nature, the Park\\nRanger will do the following:\\n* Place an electronic Marker within the video (via the BWC’s Function Button) or within\\nEvidence.com after uploading the video, AND\\n* Change the title of the video file(s) to “SENSITIVE/CONFIDENTIAL.” This will indicate to\\nthe Supervising Park Ranger that the file(s) contains something of a sensitive nature. In\\nthese situations, further discussion between the Park Ranger and the Supervising Park\\nRangers Office may be required for coordination.\\n* Park Rangers are also encouraged to provide additional information in Evidence.com as\\nto the sensitive or confidential nature of the video by adding notes within the video file.\\nThis will assist the Supervising Park Ranger with proper identification of the\\nsensitive/confidential evidence.\\nDOCUMENTING USE OF THE BODY WORN CAMERA\\nPark Rangers should not substitute a BWC recording for a detailed and thorough report. Park\\nRangers should continue to prepare reports as outlined in Department policy.\\nIf a Park Ranger is required to write a report or citation, the Park Ranger will also document in the\\nreport or citation the fact that a BWC was used to record the incident. If the BWC was not activated\\nas per policy, the Park Ranger shall document in the report or citation the reason and/or\\njustification for not activating their camera. Park Rangers shall advise Dispatch if the BWC was\\nactivated or not activated when clearing a call for service.\\nREVIEW OF BODY WORN CAMERA FILES\\nAll BWC video file viewing and sharing is for City business use only.

For other reasons as specified with the permission of the Director or designee.\\nException: Department members identified as Administrative Users may access BWC files from\\na computer or device outside of the Department for the purpose of completing administrative\\ntasks, such as locking or unlocking users, etc.\\nPROCEDURES RELATED TO VIEWING BODY WORN CAMERA FILES PRIOR TO\\nMAKING STATEMENTS\\nThe Department recognizes that the video images recorded on the BWC are two dimensional and\\ncannot always capture the entire scene due to a number of limiting factors. The BWC file(s) should\\nbe considered as just one piece of evidence collected from a scene or incident and not a\\nsingularly-inclusive piece of evidence.\\nFollowing a use of force that causes, or is reasonably expected to cause great bodily harm,\\nsubstantial bodily harm, loss of consciousness, or death that requires a Park Ranger to make a\\nstatement related to that incident, Park Rangers and their representative(s) shall not view their\\nBWC video, or any video capturing their image or the incident on any device, prior to making an\\ninitial statement.

This means that an employee will\\nreceive no more for a sick leave payout, after having met the requirements set forth\\nabove, than he or she would have been entitled to on June 22, 2013. Any sick leave\\nusage after June 22, 2013, will come first from the sick leave balance accrued after June\\n22, 2013. An employee will continue to accrue sick leave after June 22, 2013, but it may\\nnot be used for sick leave payout purposes.\\nFor example, if an employee’s hourly rate is $40 and his or her sick leave balance is\\n1000 hours on June 22, 2013, then if he or she meets the eligibility requirements\\ncontained herein, the payout of a sick leave balance at the time of retirement will be\\nbased on the formula below, and shall be based on no more than 1000 hours and an\\nhourly rate of no more than $40. This will occur even if the employee has subsequently\\nearned more than 1000 hours in sick leave or received a pay increase to an hourly rate\\nhigher than $40. In this example, if the employee does not have available sick leave to\\nuse that was accrued after June 22, 2013, and uses sick leave and reduces their sick\\nleave balance on June 22, 2013, to 800 hours, they will only be entitled to a sick leave\\npayout of 800 hours, regardless of any sick leave accrued after June 22, 2013. This\\nmeans that if sick leave payout hours are reduced by usage, they are not able to be re-\\nestablished in the sick leave balance subject to payout.\\n18.5 Payout shall be determined as follows.\\n18.5.1 Payout shall be determined as follows: If a full-time or eligible part-time\\nemployee at the time of retirement or death has earned unused sick leave hours,\\nthe employee or estate shall be paid the equivalent of a specified percent of their\\nhourly rate of pay as of June 22, 2013, multiplied by the total number of\\naccumulated and unused hours of sick leave as of June 22, 2013 (minus any sick\\nleave hours as of June 22, 2013, which were used), as follows:\\n18.5.2 Less than 400 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n50% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013;\\nor 400 - 799 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n60% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013;\\nor 800 - 1200 hours - Hours accumulated as of June 22, 2013 x\\n75% of hourly rate as of June 22, 2013.\\n18.6 Use of previously accumulated sick leave hours. For purposes of determining the total\\nnumber of accumulated and unused hours of sick leave of a full-time employee at the\\nOE #3 MOA July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024 Page 37\\ntime of retirement or death, unused sick leave from prior periods of employment before\\nJune 22, 2013, with the City shall be used. However, previously accumulated sick leave\\nshall be credited to the employee for use during an employee’s current employment\\nperiod.\\nARTICLE 19 DISABILITY LEAVE\\n19.1 Disability Leave Supplement (DLS). Disability Leave Supplement (DLS) was the benefit\\nprovided pursuant to this Article, which, when added to Worker\\'s Compensation\\nTemporary Disability (WCTD), resulted in providing employees 85% of their regular base\\nsalary. Effective April 27, 2014, employees were no longer be eligible to receive DLS.\\n19.2 Termination of Disability Leave. An employee who is unable to return to full time regular\\nduty following the expiration of any and all leave (and the integration of Sick Leave as\\nprovided for in Article 18.1.2.3) including the integration of accrued vacation,\\ncompensatory time, and sick leave as provided in Article 19.3, with Workers’\\nCompensation may be considered to have voluntarily separated from employment.\\n19.3 Integration. The integration of an employee’s available leave will occur in the following\\norder: (1) accrued Vacation hours, (2) earned Compensatory Time once Vacation has\\nbeen exhausted, and (3) accrued Sick Leave once Vacation and Compensatory Time\\nhave both been exhausted.\\n• In no event shall an employee receive an amount, including any Workers’\\nCompensation Temporary Disability payments, in excess of the employee’s\\nregular base salary.\\nARTICLE 20 MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP\\n20.1 Employee Rights.\\n20.1.1 The City and the Organization recognize the right of employees to form, join, and\\nparticipate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal,\\nalternative right of employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee\\norganizations.

Amortization of\\nchanges in the unfunded retiree healthcare liability other than the initial retiree\\nhealthcare liability (e.g. gains, losses, changes in actuarial assumptions, etc.) shall be\\ndetermined by the Plan’s actuary. The City and Plan members (active employees) shall\\ncontribute to funding the ARC in the ratio currently provided under Section 3.28.385 of\\nthe San Jose Municipal Code. Specifically, contributions for retiree medical benefits\\nshall be made by the City and members in the ratio of one-to-one.
