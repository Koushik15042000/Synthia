      "include, but are not limite d to, engaging in physically strenuous tasks, such as making \n",
      "forcible arrests, pursuing fleeing suspects, responding to mass celebrations and \n",
      "demonstrations, and responding to emergency situations.  \n",
      "3. The City and SJPOA recognize that officers and sergeants w ith physical restrictions can \n",
