Despite being a Spartak Moscow fan, Alenichev debuted 1991 for Moscow rivals Lokomotiv, where he played during four years before moving to Spartak, where in five years he won three Russian leagues and two cups, and was also elected Russian player of the year in 1997. He won a transfer to Serie A side AS Roma, played 21 matches in the first season, but after only seven matches played, he moved to AC Perugia in December 1999.In 2000 he was bought by FC Porto, where he made a good first impression, and made a good first season where Porto captured the Portuguese cup 2-0 against CS Mar\u00edtimo, Alenichev scoring the second goal. In the following season, Alenichev suffered some animosity from new Porto coach Oct\u00e1vio Machado and spent most of the first half of the season sidelined, under the shadow of Deco. As soon as Oct\u00e1vio was fired and replaced with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Alenichev's luck changed. Although he still didn't play in the starting eleven, he was usually the first player to jump from the bench, especially when Mourinho passed from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 formation. A starting player in the UEFA Cup final and mid-game substitute in the Champions League final, Alenichev scored on both: against Celtic he scored the second goal, following a pass from Deco, and against AS Monaco he closed the scoreline with a powerful volley shot following a deflected through cross from Derlei. This made him one of only three players to score goals in two consecutive Cup Finals of different European competitions, the others being Ronald Koeman and Ronaldo. [\/INST] <http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dmitri_Alenichev> <http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/01\/rdf-schema#comment> \"Dmitri Anatolievich Alenitchev is a former professional footballer turned politician. Despite being a Spartak Moscow fan, Alenichev debuted 1991 for Moscow rivals Lokomotiv, where he played during four years before moving to Spartak, where in five years he won three Russian leagues and two cups, and was also elected Russian player of the year in 1997. He won a transfer to Serie A side AS Roma, played 21 matches in the first season, but after only seven matches played, he moved to AC Perugia in December 1999.In 2000 he was bought by FC Porto, where he made a good first impression, and made a good first season where Porto captured the Portuguese cup 2-0 against CS Mar\u00edtimo, Alenichev scoring the second goal. In the following season, Alenichev suffered some animosity from new Porto coach Oct\u00e1vio Machado and spent most of the first half of the season sidelined, under the shadow of Deco. As soon as Oct\u00e1vio was fired and replaced with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Alenichev's luck changed. Although he still didn't play in the starting eleven, he was usually the first player to jump from the bench, especially when Mourinho passed from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 formation. A starting player in the UEFA Cup final and mid-game substitute in the Champions League final, Alenichev scored on both: against Celtic he scored the second goal, following a pass from Deco, and against AS Monaco he closed the scoreline with a powerful volley shot following a deflected through cross from Derlei.

MC Magic was born Marco Cardenas in Nogales, Mexico, but was raised in Phoenix, AZ. In 1990, he established Nastyboy Records to showcase his productions and talent. He released his first full-length album, Don't Worry, in 1995, which enabled him to recruit other artists to form the Nastyboy Klick which eventually became NB Ridaz With MC Magic's production touch, the Klick spawned a number of regional hits, particularly \"Down for Yours\" featuring Roger Troutman, which peaked at number ten for Top Rap singles in the country.
